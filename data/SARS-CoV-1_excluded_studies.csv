We aimed to identify the causative agent in the Guangdong outbreak and describe the emergence and spread of the disease within the province. METHODS: We analysed epidemiological information and collected serum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with SARS in Guangdong in mid-February, 2003. We did virus isolation, serological tests, and molecular assays to identify the causative agent. FINDINGS: SARS had been circulating in other cities of Guangdong Province for about 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou, the province's capital. A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (CoV), was isolated from specimens from three patients with SARS. Viral antigens were also directly detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from these patients. 48 of 55 (87%) patients had antibodies to SARS CoV in their convalescent sera. Genetic analysis showed that the SARS CoV isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to the other parts of the world. INTERPRETATION: SARS CoV is the infectious agent responsible for the epidemic outbreak of SARS in Guangdong. The virus isolated from patients in Guangdong is the prototype of the SARS CoV in other regions and countries.",2003,Oct-25,Lancet,362,9393,1353-8,14585636,,,#27,Zhong 2003,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
Epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): adults and children,"Zhong, N. S.; Wong, G. W.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described respiratory infection with pandemic potential. The causative agent is a new strain of coronavirus most likely originating from wild animals. This disease first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. Early in the outbreak the infection had been transmitted primarily via household contacts and healthcare settings. In late February 2003 the infection was transmitted to Hong Kong when an infected doctor from the mainland visited there. During his stay in Hong Kong at least 17 guests and visitors were infected at the hotel at which he stayed. By modern day air travel, the infection was rapidly spread to other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada by these infected guests. With the implementation of effective control strategies including early isolation of suspected cases, strict infection control measures in the hospital setting, meticulous contact tracing and quarantine, the outbreak was finally brought under control by July 2003. In addition, there were another two events of SARS in China between the end of December 2003 and January 2004 and from March to May 2004; both were readily controlled without significant patient spread.",2004,Dec,Paediatr Respir Rev,5,4,270-4,15531250,10.1016/j.prrv.2004.07.011,,#30,Zhong 2004,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review

M.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), now known to be caused by a coronavirus, probably originated in Guangdong province in southern China in late 2002. The first major outbreak occurred in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, between January and March 2003. This study reviews the clinical presentation, laboratory findings and response to four different treatment protocols. Case notes and laboratory findings were analysed and outcome measures were collected prospectively. The SARS outbreak in Guangdong province and the outbreak in Guangzhou associated with hospitals in the city are described, documenting clinical and laboratory features in a cohort of 190 patients randomly allocated to four treatment regimens. Patients were infected by close contact in either family or health-care settings, particularly following procedures likely to generate aerosols of respiratory secretions (e.g. administration of nebulized drugs and bronchoscopy). The earliest symptom was a high fever followed, in most patients, by dyspnoea, cough and myalgia, with 24 % of patients complaining of diarrhoea. The most frequent chest X-ray changes were patchy consolidation with progression to bilateral bronchopneumonia over 5-10 days. Thirty-six cases developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of whom 11 died. There was no response to antibiotics. The best response (no deaths) was seen in the group of 60 patients receiving early high-dose steroids and nasal CPAP (continuous airway positive pressure) ventilation; the other three treatment groups had significant mortality. Cross-infection to medical and nursing staff was completely prevented in one hospital by rigid adherence to barrier precautions during contact with infected patients. The use of rapid case identification and quarantine has controlled the outbreak in Guangzhou, in which more than 350 patients have been infected. Early administration of high-dose steroids and CPAP ventilation appears to offer the best supportive treatment with a reduced mortality compared with other treatment regimens.",2003,Aug,J Med Microbiol,52,Pt 8,715-20,12867568,10.1099/jmm.0.05320-0,,#59,Zhao 2003,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Janetta Skarp (2019-10-16 21:44:30)(Select): give no. deaths for cases -- can calculate CFR?; ,

A total of 99 SARS convalescent serum samples were collected from patients from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei Province, and Beijing 35-180 days after the onset of symptoms. The anti-SARS antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), neutralization assay, and Western blot. Eighty-seven serum samples were confirmed to be positive for SARS antibodies. The neutralizing antibody titer of the 87 positive sera was analyzed quantitatively by neutralization assay. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of the 87 convalescent sera was 1:61. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the neutralizing antibody titers conform to normal distribution, which suggests that the average anti-SARS antibody level in this study was representative of the convalescent antibody level of the SARS population.

"A climatologic investigation of the SARS-CoV outbreak in Beijing, China","Yuan, J.; Yun, H.; Lan, W.; Wang, W.; Sullivan, S. G.; Jia, S.; Bittles, A. H.","The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were identified in November 2002, in Guangdong Province, China. The epidemic spread rapidly within China and internationally, with 8454 recorded infections and 792 deaths by June 15, 2003. Temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity were the three key meteorological determinants affecting the transmission of SARS. The peak spread of SARS occurred at a mean temperature of 16.9 degrees C (95% CI, 10.7 degrees C to 23.1 degrees C), with a mean relative humidity of 52.2% (95% CI, 33.0% to 71.4%) and wind speed of 2.8 ms(-1) (95% CI, 2.0 to 3.6 ms(-1)). In northern China, these conditions are most likely to occur in the spring and suggest that SARS has a seasonal nature akin to viruses such as influenza and the common cold. A regression equation (Y=218.692-0.698X(t)-2.043X(h)+2.282X(w)) was derived to represent the optimal climatic conditions for the 2003 SARS epidemic.

Prevention of future outbreaks is essential and requires understanding pathogenesis and evolution of the virus. We have isolated a SARS-CoV in China and analyzed 47 SARS-CoV genomes with the aims to reveal the evolution trends of the virus and provide insights into understanding pathogenesis and SARS epidemic. Specimen from a SARS patient was inoculated into cell culture. The presence of SARS-CoV was determined by RT-PCR and confirmed by electron microscopy. Virus was isolated followed by the determination of its genome sequences, which were then analyzed by comparing with other 46 SARS-CoV genomes. Genetic mutations with potential implications to pathogenesis and the epidemic were characterized. This viral genome consists of 29,728 nucleotides with overall organization in agreement with that of published isolates. A total of 348 positions were mutated on 47 viral genomes. Among them 22 had mutations in more than three genomes. Hot spots of nucleotide variations and unique trends of mutations were identified on the viral genomes.

Serum samples taken at various times were tested for IgG and IgM; dynamic serological changes in these antibodies were described. The positive responses of IgM and IgG antibodies in sera against SARS virus from the first week to the sixth week after onset of the illness in patients with SARS were measured. The ELISA test of IgG antibody was negative in 200 community controls. The positive rate in the SARS high-risk population was 0.61% tested by ELISA and 0.21% by IFA. The high-risk population in this study was defined as those who provided health care and other services to SARS patients during the outbreak. IgG antibody in convalescent serum of patients with SARS revealed an increasing trend, peaking at the 22nd week after onset of illness followed by a slow decline. IgM appeared earlier than IgG and can be better used for early detection. IgG remained at a high level for a much longer period, serving as a good indicator for follow-up and for assessing past exposure.

Corticosteroid treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong,"Yam, L. Y.; Lau, A. C.; Lai, F. Y.; Shung, E.; Chan, J.; Wong, V.","BACKGROUND: The patterns of corticosteroids usage in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and associated treatment outcomes in Hong Kong were studied. METHOD: Patients> or =18 years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14 days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15 days or other investigational treatment within 21 days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. RESULTS: Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8-10 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates. CONCLUSION: We speculate that corticosteroid with higher in-vitro inflammatory potency administered at timing and dosages commensurate with disease severity may be conducive to better outcome from SARS as a consequence of more effective control of immunopathological lung damage.",2007,Jan,J Infect,54,1,28-39,16542729,10.1016/j.jinf.2006.01.005,,#369,Yam 2007,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Janetta Skarp (2019-10-15 22:16:21)(Select): More about risks of death.

Spatial pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome in-out flow in 2003 in Mainland China,"Xu, C.; Wang, J.; Wang, L.; Cao, C.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 32 countries and regions within a few months in 2003. There were 5327 SARS cases from November 2002 to May 2003 in Mainland China, which involved 29 provinces, resulted in 349 deaths, and directly caused economic losses of $18.3 billion. METHODS: This study used an in-out flow model and flow mapping to visualize and explore the spatial pattern of SARS transmission in different regions. In-out flow is measured by the in-out degree and clustering coefficient of SARS. Flow mapping is an exploratory method of spatial visualization for interaction data. RESULTS: The findings were as follows. (1) SARS in-out flow had a clear hierarchy. It formed two main centers, Guangdong in South China and Beijing in North China, and two secondary centers, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, both connected to Beijing. (2) ""Spring Festival travel"" strengthened external flow, but ""SARS panic effect"" played a more significant role and pushed the external flow to the peak. (3) External flow and its three typical kinds showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, such as self-spreading flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases only within the province or municipality of onset and medical locations); hospitalized flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases that had been seen by a hospital doctor); and migrant flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases among migrant workers). (4) Internal and external flow tended to occur in younger groups, and occupational differentiation was particularly evident. Low-income groups of male migrants aged 19-35 years were the main routes of external flow. CONCLUSIONS: During 2002-2003, SARS in-out flow played an important role in countrywide transmission of the disease in Mainland China. The flow had obvious spatial heterogeneity, which was influenced by migrants' behavior characteristics. In addition, the Chinese holiday effect led to irregular spread of SARS, but the panic effect was more apparent in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. These findings constitute valuable input to prevent and control future serious infectious diseases like SARS.",2014,Dec-31,BMC Infect Dis,14,,721,25551367,10.1186/s12879-014-0721-y,,#405,Xu 2014,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

A medical professional who had worked with SARS patients in Guangdong visited Hong Kong on 21 February 2003. The disease quickly spread to 26 countries with local transmission in Singapore, Hanoi, Hong Kong and Toronto. The agent of SARS is an RNA coronavirus, not seen before in humans, known as SARS-CoV (1). The virus has been isolated from specimens (2); the genome has been sequenced (3); and infectivity in monkeys has been demonstrated. At the end of the 2003 epidemic, 8098 possible cases and 744 deaths were reported to WHO (4).

Although SARS has been controlled, the potential evolution of this virus is not well understood. This paper reviews the epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic; inconsistencies in transmissibility and mortality, the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV (4), the results of mathematical modelling, and evidence of evolution towards virulence in pathogens in similar settings.

H.","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) while caring for SARS patients. Personal protective equipment and negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) have not been completely successful in protecting HCWs. We introduced an innovative, integrated infection control strategy involving triaging patients using barriers, zones of risk, and extensive installation of alcohol dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing. This integrated infection control approach was implemented at a SARS designated hospital ('study hospital') where NPIRs were not available. The number of HCWs who contracted SARS in the study hospital was compared with the number of HCWs who contracted SARS in 86 Taiwan hospitals that did not use the integrated infection control strategy. Two HCWs contracted SARS in the study hospital (0.03 cases/bed) compared with 93 HCWs in the other hospitals (0.13 cases/bed) during the same three-week period. Our strategy appeared to be effective in reducing the incidence of HCWs contracting SARS. The advantages included rapid implementation without NPIRs, flexibility to transfer patients, and re-inforcement for HCWs to comply with infection control procedures, especially handwashing. The efficacy and low cost are major advantages, especially in countries with large populations at risk and fewer economic resources.",2006,Feb,J Hosp Infect,62,2,195-9,16153744,10.1016/j.jhin.2005.02.011,,#607,Yen 2006,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,Intervention
Modelling input-output flows of severe acute respiratory syndrome in mainland China,"Wang, L.; Wang, J.; Xu, C.; Liu, T.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in China in 2002, and it spread to 26 provinces in mainland China and 32 countries across five continents in a matter of months. This outbreak resulted in 774 deaths. However, the spatial features and potential determinants of SARS input-output flows remain unclear. METHODS: We used an adjusted spatial interaction model to examine the spatial effects and potential factors associated with SARS input-output flows. RESULTS: The presence of origin-based spatial dependence positively affected SARS input-output flows from the neighbours of the origin regions. Two components of the input-output flows, migrant and hospitalization flows, exhibited distinctive features. The origin-based and destination-based spatial dependence positively affected migrant flows (i.e., due to those seeking jobs) from the neighbours of origin and destination locations. Similarly, the destination-based spatial dependence also positively affected hospitalization flows (i.e., due to those seeking treatment) from the neighbours of destination regions. However, the origin-to-destination based spatial dependence negatively affected hospitalisation flows from the neighbours of origin-to-destination regions. The direct effects accounted for 78% of the SARS input-output flows, which was 3.56-fold greater than the indirect effects. Differences in regional income drove the SARS input-output flows. Therefore, urban income had a positive effect, whereas rural income had a negative effect. Total interregional flows increased by 3.54% with a 1% increase in urban income, and intraregional flows increased by 8.35%. In contrast, the total interregional flows decreased by 3.38% with a 1% increase in rural income, and intraregional flows declined by 2.29%. Railway capacity, per person gross domestic product (PGDP), urban rate and the law of distance decay also affected the input-output flows. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the SARS input-output flows presented significant geographic spatial heterogeneity and spatial effects. Income differences were the major cause of the flows between pairs of regions. Railway capacity, PGDP, and urban rate also played important roles. These findings provide valuable information for the Chinese government to control the future spread of nationwide epidemics.",2016,Feb-29,BMC Public Health,16,,191,26924026,10.1186/s12889-016-2867-6,,#631,Wang 2016,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2023-12-15 21:55:00)(Select): Kelly+Bethan kick back; ,
Severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Wang, J. T.; Chang, S. C.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. It spread to many countries all over the world during February to June 2003, with 8098 cases reported. Twenty-one percent of the affected people were health care workers. Because SARS is a new emerging disease, this review describes the current understanding about the etiology, clinical pictures, laboratory and radiological findings of SARS. RECENT FINDINGS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was quickly found to be the etiological agent of SARS in April 2003. The transmission of SARS-CoV between human beings is mainly due to close contact. Using barrier precautions, the transmission of SARS-CoV can be prevented. The most common clinical presentations of patients with SARS include fever, cough, and dyspnea. The common laboratory findings include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein. The most common radiological finding is pneumonic lesion(s) in the chest radiogram. Many patients experience exacerbation of clinical symptoms in the second week of disease course and some may progress to respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilatory support. The overall case fatality rate is 9.6%. The current method of treatment of SARS is still controversial. SUMMARY: SARS is an infectious disease with high contagiousness and a high mortality rate. Early case identification and infection control are two important factors to limit its spread.",2004,Apr,Curr Opin Infect Dis,17,2,143-8,15021055,,,#642,Wang 2004,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review

This drill provided the opportunity to evaluate the ability of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (NYC-DOHMH) emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system to detect a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness. METHODS: The evaluation was a prospective simulation. The clinical picture was modeled on severe acute respiratory syndrome symptoms. Forty-four volunteers participated in the drill as mock patients. RESULTS: Records from 42 patients (95%) were successfully transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH. The electronic chief complaint for 24 (57%) of these patients indicated febrile or respiratory illness. The drill did not generate a statistical signal in the NYC-DOHMH SaTScan analysis. The 42 drill patients were classified in 8 hierarchical categories based on chief complaints: sepsis (2), cold (3), diarrhea (2), respiratory (20), fever/flu (4), vomit (3), and other (8). The number of respiratory visits, while elevated on the day of the drill, did not appear particularly unusual when compared with the 14-day baseline period used for spatial analyses.

Serial intervals of respiratory infectious diseases: a systematic review and analysis,"Vink, M. A.; Bootsma, M. C.; Wallinga, J.","The serial interval of an infectious disease represents the duration between symptom onset of a primary case and symptom onset of its secondary cases. A good evidence base for such values is essential, because they allow investigators to identify epidemiologic links between cases and serve as an important parameter in epidemic transmission models used to design infection control strategies. We reviewed the literature for available data sets containing serial intervals and for reported values of serial intervals. We were able to collect data on outbreaks within households, which we reanalyzed to infer a mean serial interval using a common statistical method. We estimated the mean serial intervals for influenza A(H3N2) (2.2 days), pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2.8 days), respiratory syncytial virus (7.5 days), measles (11.7 days), varicella (14.0 days), smallpox (17.7 days), mumps (18.0 days), rubella (18.3 days), and pertussis (22.8 days). For varicella, we found an evidence-based value that deviates substantially from the 21 days commonly used in transmission models. This value of the serial interval for pertussis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that is based on observations. Our review reveals that, for most infectious diseases, there is very limited evidence to support the serial intervals that are often cited.",2014,Nov-01,Am J Epidemiol,180,9,865-75,25294601,10.1093/aje/kwu209,,#750,Vink 2014,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Anne Cori (2019-09-12 23:52:56)(Select): only has one estimate for SARS (8.4 days from Lipsitch 2003); ,SARS review

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a review,"Vijayanand, P.; Wilkins, E.; Woodhead, M.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged disease that rapidly spread around the world. The disease originated in southern China and a novel coronavirus (SARS CoV) has been implicated as the causative organism. The path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery, though preliminary data point to origins in an animal reservoir. Nosocomial transmission of SARS CoV has been a striking feature in this epidemic. The clinical illness is similar to many acute respiratory infections, although a large proportion of patients show a rapid deterioration with respiratory distress towards the end of the second week of illness. The management principles are broadly similar to treating any community acquired pneumonia but the infection control measures take a pivotal role. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS CoV. The most remarkable feature about the SARS epidemic was the speed with which the global community acted in a coordinated way to control it.",2004,Mar-Apr,Clin Med (Lond),4,2,152-60,15139736,,,#759,Vijayanand 2004,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review
Loss of paramedic availability in an urban emergency medical services system during a severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak,"Verbeek, P. R.; McClelland, I. W.; Silverman, A. C.; Burgess, R. J.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the loss of paramedic availability to Toronto Emergency Medical Services during a biphasic (SARS-1 and SARS-2) outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: During the SARS outbreak, a dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program was developed. The authors determined the number of paramedics on quarantine each day, the type of quarantine (either home quarantine [HQ] or work quarantine [WQ]), and the development of SARS-like symptoms. RESULTS: During the SARS outbreak, there were five cases of probable SARS and three cases of suspect SARS. SARS-1 lasted 30 days, during which 234 paramedics were placed on HQ. The total number of HQ days was 1,615. During the five peak days of SARS-1, the total number of HQ days was 664. SARS-2 lasted 18 days, during which 292 paramedics were placed on either HQ or WQ, for a combined number of quarantine days of 1,637. During the five peak days of SARS-2, the combined number of quarantine days was 910. Of these, paramedics were available for duty on 708 days (78%) due to the WQ program. The primary reason for quarantine was unprotected exposure to a health care institution experiencing a SARS outbreak. Under quarantine, SARS-like symptoms developed in 68 paramedics, including cough (53 [78%]), myalgia (33 [48%]), fatigue (30 [44%]), headache (29 [43%]), fever (11 [16%]), and shortness of breath (7 [10%]). CONCLUSIONS: Paramedics were among the health care workers who developed SARS. During SARS-2, WQ optimized the number of days on which paramedics were available for duty. Many paramedics developed SARS-like symptoms without being diagnosed as having SARS.

"Experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome in singapore: importation of cases, and defense strategies at the airport","Wilder-Smith, A.; Paton, N. I.; Goh, K. T.","BACKGROUND: The importation of SARS was responsible for the outbreaks in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Canada at a time when this new disease had not been identified. We report the incidence and impact of cases of SARS imported to Singapore between 25 February and 31 May 2003, and describe national measures to prevent further importation. METHODS: Information on imported cases of SARS and measures taken at entry points to Singapore was retrieved from the Ministry of Health and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. RESULTS: Of the 6 imported cases, which all occurred before screening measures were implemented at the airport, only the first resulted in extensive secondary transmission. Of 442973 air passengers screened after measures were implemented, 136 were sent to a designated hospital for further SARS screening; none was diagnosed as having SARS. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS outbreak in Singapore can be traced to the first imported case. The absence of transmission from the other imported cases was probably a result of relatively prompt identification and isolation of cases, together with a low potential for transmission. New imported SARS cases therefore need not lead to major outbreaks if systems are in place to identify and isolate them early. Screening at entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself, but may be justified in light of the major economic, social and international impact which even a single imported SARS case may have.",2003,Sep-Oct,J Travel Med,10,5,259-62,14531977,,,#894,Wilder-Smith 2003,Exclusion reason: Case report/case study; ,

Simulation Study on Effects of Order and Step Size of Runge-Kutta Methods that Solve Contagious Disease and Tumor Models,"Wang, Z.; Wang, Q.; Klinke, D. J., 2nd","Biological processes such as contagious disease spread patterns and tumor growth dynamics are modelled using a set of coupled differential equations. Experimental data is usually used to calibrate models so they can be used to make future predictions. In this study, numerical methods were implemented to approximate solutions to mathematical models that were not solvable analytically, such as a SARS model. More complex models such as a tumor growth model involve high-dimensional parameter spaces; efficient numerical simulation techniques were used to search for optimal or close-to-optimal parameter values in the equations. Runge-Kutta methods are a group of explicit and implicit numerical methods that effectively solve the ordinary differential equations in these models. Effects of the order and the step size of Runge-Kutta methods were studied in order to maximize the search accuracy and efficiency in parameter spaces of the models. Numerical simulation results showed that an order of four gave the best balance between truncation errors and the simulation speed for SIR, SARS, and tumormodels studied in the project.

Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. SETTING: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: health-care workers ( n=16), relatives ( n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments ( n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated and nonintubated patients in white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, and C-reactive protein level as well as in age and underlying malignancy. Risk factors for SARS patients who had been healthy prior to their illness included old age, high peak fever grade, increased neutrophil count, increased neutrophil percentage, and close or prolonged contact with a SARS patient.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Thomas, P. A.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a form of atypical pneumonia that apparently originated in Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in late 2002. This first came to the world's attention in late February 2003, and has since spread worldwide.

A novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS- CoV) has been found in various specimens taken from patients with SARS. Although there has been rapid development of tests to detect SARS Co-V, these tests presently have certain limitations. Definitions of suspected, confirmed and probable cases have been formulated. Measures currently used for the management of patients with SARS include isolation, ribavirin, corticosteroid therapy and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, almost 10 % of affected patients succumb to their illness, underlying the need for developing more effective therapy.

Clinical histories, laboratory investigations and radiological findings were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 57.6 years (range: 38-78 years). Nine patients had concomitant medical conditions. Three patients were in the early postoperative period, while the remaining seven were admitted for surgical related infections. All patients presented with fever, but only eight had accompanying respiratory symptoms. Lymphopenia and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was seen in seven patients. Eight patients had positive bacterial cultures. The primary abnormality on chest radiograph was air-space opacification. Rapid progression of radiological changes was seen in seven patients. Mortality rate for our cohort is 20%. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of SARS in surgical patients differs from that previously described in normal patients. An apparent cause of fever and positive blood cultures cannot exclude a diagnosis of SARS. The current WHO case definition could result in delayed or even missed diagnosis. Early isolation of febrile patients with a positive contact history must be undertaken, even in the face of another identifiable cause.",2005,Jan-Feb,ANZ J Surg,75,01-Feb,21-Jun,15740510,10.1111/j.1445-2197.2005.03285.x,,#1173,Tan 2005,Exclusion reason: Case report/case study; ,

SARS: how to manage future outbreaks?,"Tai, D. Y.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was an unknown disease barely 3 years ago. After the World Health Organization declared the world SARS-free on 5 July 2003, there were episodic recurrences of SARS between September 2003 and May 2004, including 4 cases of laboratory-acquired SARS. SARS posed a mammoth challenge because of the impact of nosocomial transmission on healthcare manpower and facilities, and the resources needed for controlling and preventing further spread. Through worldwide scientific collaboration, the medical community has made much progress in unraveling its enigma, though much more needs to be discovered. This paper highlights how we can apply our knowledge of its epidemiology, mode of transmission, clinical course, ICU admission, complications, predictors of poor outcome, treatment and infection control to help us avert a catastrophic outbreak, and to manage our resources and patients. SARS preparedness and response planning must be flexible and dynamic so that appropriate measures can be implemented as an outbreak progresses. Even if SARS does not reemerge, the experience gained from such planning is valuable in preparing for threats of bioterrorism or a global avian influenza A (H5N1) virus pandemic.",2006,May,Ann Acad Med Singapore,35,5,368-73,16830006,,,#1204,Tai 2006,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review
Clinical diagnostic approach to severe acute respiratory syndrome: an institution's experience,"Sun, Y.; Yao, W.; Wang, X.; He, B.; Zhao, M.; Sun, B.; Shan, Y.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, F.; Sun, W.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze diagnostic approach to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) according to the diagnostic criteria issued by the Ministry of Health of China (MHC). METHODS: The clinical data and the diagnostic results of 108 cases of SARS were retrospectively reviewed according to the MHC criteria. RESULTS: There were 55 men and 53 women, with a median age of 34.5 years (range, 12 - 78 years). The interval between their first visit and clinical diagnosis was 3 days (range, 0 - 14 days). The diagnosis was made at the first visit in 7 (6.5%, 7/108) cases with a history of exposure to SARS patients and infiltrates on chest radiograph. Eighty-nine (82.4%) and 12 (11.1%) patients were categorized as probable cases and suspected cases respectively at their first visit and a clinical diagnosis of SARS was made subsequently. The interval between first visit and reaching the final diagnosis was 1 - 3 days in 72 (66.7%) cases and 4 days in 29 (26.9%) cases. The final diagnosis was made in 0 - 14 days (median, 2 days) for those (n = 59, 54.6%) with a history of close contact with SARS patients and 2 - 8 days (median, 3 days) for those (n = 49, 45.4%) living in Beijing but without such a history (P = 0.03). The chest radiograph was interpreted as unremarkable in 26 (24.1%) cases at their first visit, and the diagnosis was made in 4 days (range 2 - 8 days), which was significantly longer compared with other cases (P < 0.001). In patients without a history of close contact with SARS patients, all the five criteria were met after combination antibiotic therapy had failed. CONCLUSIONS: A chest radiograph without infiltrates at the early stage of SARS is an important factor responsible for delayed diagnosis. In patients without a history of close contact with SARS cases, antibiotic effect was a major factor influencing doctors' diagnosis.",2003,Oct,Chin Med J (Engl),116,10,1464-6,14570601,,,#1239,Sun 2003,"Exclusion reason: No peer review; Isobel Routledge (2019-10-10 01:18:54)(Select): has date of receipt but not acceptance, therefore not peer reviewed?; ","Diagnostics; Relevant, not peer reviewed"

Controlling nosocomial infection based on structure of hospital social networks,"Ueno, T.; Masuda, N.","Nosocomial infection (i.e. infection in healthcare facilities) raises a serious public health problem, as implied by the existence of pathogens characteristic to healthcare facilities such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and hospital-mediated outbreaks of influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome. For general communities, epidemic modeling based on social networks is being recognized as a useful tool. However, disease propagation may occur in a healthcare facility in a manner different from that in a urban community setting due to different network architecture. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed social networks in the hospital have hierarchical and modular structure in which dense substructure such as departments, wards, and rooms, are globally but only loosely connected, and do not reveal extremely right-skewed distributions of the number of contacts per individual. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors (i.e. transmitters) of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating individuals with large betweenness centrality (frequency of mediating connection between pairs of individuals along the shortest paths) is superior to vaccinating ones with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, which was suggested by previous model studies.",2008,Oct-07,J Theor Biol,254,3,655-66,18647609,10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.07.001,,#1352,Ueno 2008,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen/pathogen epidemiology or transmission not the main focus; ,

L.; Conly, J.","Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) may expose health care workers (HCWs) to pathogens causing acute respiratory infections (ARIs), but the risk of transmission of ARIs from AGPs is not fully known. We sought to determine the clinical evidence for the risk of transmission of ARIs to HCWs caring for patients undergoing AGPs compared with the risk of transmission to HCWs caring for patients not undergoing AGPs. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, University of York CRD databases, EuroScan, LILACS, Indian Medlars, Index Medicus for SE Asia, international health technology agencies and the Internet in all languages for articles from 01/01/1990 to 22/10/2010. Independent reviewers screened abstracts using pre-defined criteria, obtained full-text articles, selected relevant studies, and abstracted data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The outcome of interest was risk of ARI transmission. The quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system. We identified 5 case-control and 5 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS to HCWs. Procedures reported to present an increased risk of transmission included [n; pooled OR(95%CI)] tracheal intubation [n = 4 cohort; 6.6 (2.3, 18.9), and n = 4 case-control; 6.6 (4.1, 10.6)], non-invasive ventilation [n = 2 cohort; OR 3.1(1.4, 6.8)], tracheotomy [n = 1 case-control; 4.2 (1.5, 11.5)] and manual ventilation before intubation [n = 1 cohort; OR 2.8 (1.3, 6.4)].

Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5 x 10(9) vs 4.6 x 10(9) neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients.

C.; Hsiao, C. H.; Hseuh, P. R.; Chie, W. C.; Yang, P. C.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly transmissible disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Death from SARS is most often due to rapidly progressive respiratory compromise (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction. However, the mechanisms evoking respiratory distress and a fulminant systemic response remain unclear. In order to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS, we analyzed clinical manifestations and levels of serum cytokines of SARS patients. METHODS: Fourteen hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus infection at National Taiwan University Hospital from March to May 2003 were included. Data on clinical manifestations, parameters of laboratory tests, complications and final outcomes of patients were collected retrospectively. Serial plasma inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of preserved serum were measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: All 14 patients had fever, dry cough and dyspnea. Twelve were intubated during hospitalization. The median duration from onset of fever to the nadir level or most severe condition was 9 days for hypoxia, 7 days for lymphocytopenia, 6.5 days for thrombocytopenia, 9.5 days for maximal pulmonary infiltrates; to peak serum levels was 9 days for C-reactive protein (CRP), 10.5 days for IL-6, 13.5 days for IL-8 and 12 days for TNF-alpha; to defervescence was 13 days. There was no significant elevation of serum IL-1beta levels in any of the 14 patients. There were no significant differences in peak levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha between patients with and without ARDS. The 8 patients who died tended to have higher peak levels of serum TNF-alpha compared to those who survived (14 vs 9.1 pg/mL; p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Rapid elevation of inflammatory cytokines-IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha might play a role in the development of SARS-related ARDS. The timing of elevations in inflammatory cytokines and CRP is correlated with progression of pulmonary infiltrates of SARS patients. The peak level of serum TNF-alpha tends to be higher in patients who die of SARS than in those who survive. Our results indicate that CRP and TNF-alpha might be used as prognostic markers of SARS.",2005,Oct,J Formos Med Assoc,104,10,715-23,16385373,,,#1526,Sheng 2005,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
Polymorphism of SARS-CoV genomes,"Shang, L.; Qi, Y.; Bao, Q. Y.; Tian, W.; Xu, J. C.; Feng, M. G.; Yang, H. M.","In this work, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome BJ202 (AY864806) was completely sequenced. The genome was directly accessed from the stool sample of a patient in Beijing. Comparative genomics methods were used to analyze the sequence variations of 116 SARS-CoV genomes (including BJ202) available in the NCBI GenBank. With the genome sequence of GZ02 as the reference, there were 41 polymorphic sites identified in BJ202 and a total of 278 polymorphic sites present in at least two of the 116 genomes. The distribution of the polymorphic sites was biased over the whole genome. Nearly half of the variations (50.4%, 140/278) clustered in the one third of the whole genome at the 3' end (19.0 kb-29.7 kb). Regions encoding Orf10-11, Orf3/4, E, M and S protein had the highest mutation rates. A total of 15 PCR products (about 6.0 kb of the genome) including 11 fragments containing 12 known polymorphic sites and 4 fragments without identified polymorphic sites were cloned and sequenced. Results showed that 3 unique polymorphic sites of BJ202 (positions 13 804, 15 031 and 20 792) along with 3 other polymorphic sites (26 428, 26 477 and 27 243) all contained 2 kinds of nucleotides. It is interesting to find that position 18379 which has not been identified to be polymorphic in any of the other 115 published SARS-CoV genomes is actually a polymorphic site. The nucleotide composition of this site is A (8) to G (6). Among 116 SARS-CoV genomes, 18 types of deletions and 2 insertions were identified. Most of them were related to a 300 bp region (27,700-28,000) which encodes parts of the putative ORF9 and ORF10-11. A phylogenetic tree illustrating the divergence of whole BJ202 genome from 115 other completely sequenced SARS-CoVs was also constructed.

Development of a nucleocapsid-based human coronavirus immunoassay and estimates of individuals exposed to coronavirus in a U.S. metropolitan population,"Severance, E. G.; Bossis, I.; Dickerson, F. B.; Stallings, C. R.; Origoni, A. E.; Sullens, A.; Yolken, R. H.; Viscidi, R. P.","Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections ranging from common colds to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. Estimates for exposure to non-SARS coronaviruses are high, particularly for 229E and OC43; however, less information regarding seroprevalence is available for HKU1 and NL63. To measure exposure rates to these four coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), we devised an immunoassay based on amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged recombinant coronavirus nucleocapsid antigens. Four human and one feline coronavirus antigen were cloned into baculoviruses expressed in insect cells and recovered proteins bound in the solid phase of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system. We screened sera from 10 children and 196 adults and established primary cutoff points based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels of the predominantly seronegative children. The proportion of seropositive adults for each coronavirus was as follows: 229E, 91.3%; HKU1, 59.2%; NL63, 91.8%; and OC43, 90.8%. No evidence of a significant serological response to the feline coronavirus was observed. Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses. The group II coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) were significantly associated with race (P<or=0.009 and P<or=0.03, respectively). Elevated OC43 IgG levels were further significantly associated with smoking status (P<or=0.03), as were high NL63 titers with socioeconomic status (P<or=0.04). The high-level immunoreactivity of each coronavirus was significantly associated with the summer season (P<or=0.01 to 0.0001). In summary, high rates of exposure to 229E, NL63, and OC43 and a moderate rate of exposure to HKU1 characterized the seroprevalence among individuals in this population.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome in children,"Stockman, L. J.; Massoudi, M. S.; Helfand, R.; Erdman, D.; Siwek, A. M.; Anderson, L. J.; Parashar, U. D.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a febrile, respiratory tract illness caused by infection with the newly identified SARS-associated coronavirus. A notable feature of the 2003 global SARS outbreak was the relative paucity of cases reported among children. We reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical features of SARS in children and discuss implications of these findings for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of SARS. METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify reports of pediatric (younger than 18 years of age) patients meeting the World Health Organization case definitions for SARS and abstracted relevant clinical and epidemiologic information. RESULTS: We identified 6 case series reporting 135 pediatric SARS patients (80 laboratory-confirmed, 27 probable and 28 suspect) from Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Among laboratory-confirmed and probable SARS cases, the most common symptoms included fever (98%), cough (60%) and nausea or vomiting (41%); 97% had radiographic abnormalities. The clinical presentation of SARS in patients older than 12 years of age was similar to that in adults. However, patients 12 years of age or younger had milder disease and were less likely than older children to be admitted to an intensive care unit, receive supplemental oxygen or be treated with methylprednisolone. No deaths were reported among children or adolescents with SARS, and at 6 months after illness only mild residual changes were reported in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function. There is only 1 published report of transmission of SARS virus from a pediatric patient. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents are susceptible to SARS-associated coronavirus infection, although the clinical course and outcome are more favorable in children younger than 12 years of age compared with adolescents and adults.

Super-spreaders in infectious diseases,"Stein, R. A.","Early studies that explored host-pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.",2011,Aug,Int J Infect Dis,15,8,e510-3,21737332,10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020,,#1711,Stein 2011,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Isobel Routledge (2019-10-10 01:22:00)(Select): perspective; ,

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and sport: facts and fallacies,"So, R. C.; Ko, J.; Yuan, Y. W.; Lam, J. J.; Louie, L.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) not only paralysed economic activities in SARS-affected cities, it also affected sporting activities. SARS was identified in Hong Kong in late February 2003 and the WHO issued a global alert on 12 March, 2003. The incubation period of SARS is usually 4-6 days and patients commonly present with high fever (temperature >38 degrees C), dry cough, chills and rigor, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Although a specific antiviral agent and vaccines for SARS are not available at the time of writing, a standard treatment protocol for SARS has been developed. The average mortality rate is about 16% in Hong Kong.The coronavirus is a common pathogen for upper respiratory tract infection and is the most probable pathogen for SARS. Transmission methods may, therefore, be similar for both these infections. Transmission is possible when aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host's mucous membrane, most commonly the nose, but also the mouth and eyes. With appropriate preventive measures to avoid contact with virus, the probability of infection is minimal. Isolation of those who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected SARS patients and/or who have persistent fever will be the most effective and practical method of avoiding contact. Maintaining personal hygiene and frequent hand washing can also reduce the risk of infection.

Spatial dynamics of airborne infectious diseases,"Robinson, M.; Stilianakis, N. I.; Drossinos, Y.","Disease outbreaks, such as those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 and the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza, have highlighted the potential for airborne transmission in indoor environments. Respirable pathogen-carrying droplets provide a vector for the spatial spread of infection with droplet transport determined by diffusive and convective processes. An epidemiological model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets ( approximately 0.4mum) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets ( approximately 4mum) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localized susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when the basic reproduction number R(0) exceeds unity.",2012,Mar-21,J Theor Biol,297,,116-26,22207025,10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.015,,#1901,Robinson 2012,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen/pathogen epidemiology or transmission not the main focus; Anne Cori (2019-10-16 23:23:13)(Select): not sars specific; ,
SARS associated coronavirus has a recombinant polymerase and coronaviruses have a history of host-shifting,"Rest, J. S.; Mindell, D. P.","The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins. Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5' fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3' fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5' tree could be rejected for the 3' region, and the optimal 3' tree could be rejected for the 5' region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1-3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3' RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.",2003,Sep,Infect Genet Evol,3,3,219-25,14522185,,,#1960,Rest 2003,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis, and management","Rainer, T. H.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In November 2003, a new, life-threatening, respiratory illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose from Guangdong Province in China. The illness spread across the globe, caused many major outbreaks, and had an overall mortality rate of 11%. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of SARS, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathogen. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus that primarily affects the lower respiratory tract. It starts with an influenza-like illness characterized by nonspecific, systemic symptoms. This is followed by the rapid development of a non-specific bronchopneumonia associated with lower tract respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients recover after a week or 2, but some go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no proven treatment, although cocktails of broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral, and immunomodulatory therapy have been tried. Secondary spread can be prevented and outbreaks brought under control provided that staff wear personal protective equipment and pay close attention to good personal hygiene, and patients are isolated. The most urgent needs at present are to develop a vaccine, to develop rapid, inexpensive, accurate diagnostic tests that can give results early in the illness and within a few hours of sampling. Other needs are to investigate which therapies have the lowest adverse event/efficacy ratios. SUMMARY: Up-to-date knowledge of SARS should help in early detection, isolation of high-risk patients, to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to prevent a new global epidemic arising.",2004,May,Curr Opin Pulm Med,10,3,159-65,15071365,,,#2034,Rainer 2004,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review

Early clinical predictors of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the emergency department,"Wong, W. N.; Sek, A. C.; Lau, R. F.; Li, K. M.; Leung, J. K.; Tse, M. L.; Ng, A. H.; Stenstrom, R. J.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of diagnostic predictors available in the emergency department (ED) with the outcome diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study describes all patients from the Amoy Garden complex who presented to an ED SARS screening clinic during a 2-month outbreak. Clinical and diagnostic predictors were recorded, along with ED diagnoses. Final diagnoses were established independently based on diagnostic tests performed after the ED visit. Associations of key predictors with the final diagnosis of SARS were described. RESULTS: Of 821 patients, 205 had confirmed SARS, 35 undetermined SARS and 581 non-SARS. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the strongest predictors of SARS were abnormal chest x-ray (odds ratio [OR] = 17.4), subjective fever (OR = 9.7), temperature degrees >38 degrees C (OR = 6.4), myalgias (OR = 5.5), chills and rigors (OR = 4.0) and contact exposure (OR = 2.6). In a subset of 176 patients who had a complete blood cell count performed, the strongest predictors were temperature >or=38 degrees C (OR = 15.5), lymphocyte count <1000 (OR = 9.3) and abnormal chest x-ray (OR = 5.7). Diarrhea was a powerful negative predictor (OR = 0.03) of SARS. CONCLUSIONS: Two components of the World Health Organization case definition - fever and contact exposure - are helpful for ED decision-making, but respiratory symptoms do not discriminate well between SARS and non-SARS. Emergency physicians should consider the presence of diarrhea, chest x-ray findings, the absolute lymphocyte count and the platelet count as significant modifiers of disease likelihood.

Border screening for SARS in Australia: what has been learnt?,"Samaan, G.; Patel, M.; Spencer, J.; Roberts, L.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the Australian border entry screening program to detect arriving travellers with symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study of outcomes of screening at Australian airports and seaports between 5 April 2003 and 16 June 2003. To determine the number of international travellers who were symptomatic on arrival in Australia but missed by screening, data were obtained on the number of arrivals screened and the number with symptoms (from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service [AQIS]), as well as the number of people investigated for SARS (from the Australian SARS Case Register). RESULTS: There were 1.84 million arrivals into Australia during the study period, and 794 were referred for screening to AQIS staff. Of these, the findings in four travellers were consistent with the World Health Organization case definition for SARS, and they were referred by the Chief Quarantine Officers to designated hospitals for further investigation. None of these people was confirmed to have SARS. One person reported as a probable SARS case acknowledged being symptomatic on arrival, but had been missed by border screening. CONCLUSIONS: The low identification rate was attributed to the low prevalence of SARS, the use of exit screening by affected countries, and the subjective measures used in the screening process. With current knowledge about SARS, border screening should focus on educating incoming travellers, especially groups at high risk of transmitting the disease (the elderly and those with underlying chronic illnesses).

METHODS: Standardized questionnaire was used on individual cases. Data on the epidemiological characteristics as time, place, persons and aggregation status of SARS cases, development of the epidemics, were analyzed with software EPI 6.0. RESULTS: The incidence of SARS in Guangdong province was 1.72/100,000 with case fatality rate as 3.64%. Most cases of SARS occurred between the last ten days of January and the first ten days of February with the peak (61.88% of the patients) occurred in the first ten days of February. As to the distribution of place, Pearl river delta region-economically developed with great number of mobile population-was heavily affected areas (account for 96.66% of the total patients).

We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients. METHODS: We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. FINDINGS: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.

Many of these viruses cause the highest burden of disease in specific risk groups such as young infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals. Although the most important respiratory viruses of humans have been identified in the last century, in the past decade about a dozen ""new"" viruses have been discovered that may cause a high burden of acute respiratory disease in humans. Not only viruses were discovered that must have been with humans for many decades or centuries, such as human metapneumovirus and 2 different human coronaviruses, but also viruses that are truly new for humans and have emerged as a result of recent interspecies transmissions from other mammalian or avian reservoirs.

X.","AIM: To predict the probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV by bioinformatics analysis. The derived packaging signal may be used to design antisense RNA and RNA interfere (RNAi) drugs treating SARS. METHODS: Based on the studies about the genomic packaging signals of MHV and BCoV, especially the information about primary and secondary structures, the putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV were analyzed by using bioinformatic tools. Multi-alignment for the genomic sequences was performed among SARS-CoV, MHV, BCoV, PEDV and HCoV 229E. Secondary structures of RNA sequences were also predicted for the identification of the possible genomic packaging signals. Meanwhile, the N and M proteins of all five viruses were analyzed to study the evolutionary relationship with genomic packaging signals. RESULTS: The putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV locates at the 3' end of ORF1b near that of MHV and BCoV, where is the most variable region of this gene. The RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV genomic packaging signal is very similar to that of MHV and BCoV. The same result was also obtained in studying the genomic packaging signals of PEDV and HCoV 229E. Further more, the genomic sequence multi-alignment indicated that the locations of packaging signals of SARS-CoV, PEDV, and HCoV overlaped each other. It seems that the mutation rate of packaging signal sequences is much higher than the N protein, while only subtle variations for the M protein. CONCLUSIONS: The probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV is analogous to that of MHV and BCoV, with the corresponding secondary RNA structure locating at the similar region of ORF1b. The positions where genomic packaging signals exist have suffered rounds of mutations, which may influence the primary structures of the N and M proteins consequently.",2003,Jun,Acta Pharmacol Sin,24,6,489-96,12791173,,,#2441,Qin 2003,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

J.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition of unknown cause that has recently been recognized in patients in Asia, North America, and Europe. This report summarizes the initial epidemiologic findings, clinical description, and diagnostic findings that followed the identification of SARS in Canada. METHODS: SARS was first identified in Canada in early March 2003. We collected epidemiologic, clinical, and diagnostic data from each of the first 10 cases prospectively as they were identified. Specimens from all cases were sent to local, provincial, national, and international laboratories for studies to identify an etiologic agent. RESULTS: The patients ranged from 24 to 78 years old; 60 percent were men. Transmission occurred only after close contact. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (in 100 percent of cases) and malaise (in 70 percent), followed by nonproductive cough (in 100 percent) and dyspnea (in 80 percent) associated with infiltrates on chest radiography (in 100 percent). Lymphopenia (in 89 percent of those for whom data were available), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (in 80 percent), elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (in 78 percent), and elevated creatinine kinase levels (in 56 percent) were common. Empirical therapy most commonly included antibiotics, oseltamivir, and intravenous ribavirin. Mechanical ventilation was required in five patients. Three patients died, and five have had clinical improvement. The results of laboratory investigations were negative or not clinically significant except for the amplification of human metapneumovirus from respiratory specimens from five of nine patients and the isolation and amplification of a novel coronavirus from five of nine patients.

SARS outbreak in Germany 2003: workload of local health departments and their compliance in quarantine measures--implications for outbreak modeling and surge capacity?,"Porten, K.; Faensen, D.; Krause, G.","OBJECTIVE: Public health management of severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic must be evaluated to improve contingency planning for epidemics. METHODS: Standardized questionnaires on case management were sent to local health departments of 15 of 16 states in Germany. RESULTS: Of the 384 local health departments who received the questionnaire, 280 (72%) completed them. They reported 271 suspect or probable severe acute respiratory syndrome cases under investigation (average 4.7). The average duration of quarantine was 5.4 days. Contacts without professional activity were 2.78 times more likely to stay under 10-day quarantine than those with professional activity (CI: 0.80-9.86). Local health departments with at least one case under investigation had invested an average of 104.5 working hours. CONCLUSIONS: Our contact-case ratios may serve for planning for modeling in epidemics.

"Investigation of the second wave (phase 2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, Canada. What happened?","Ofner-Agostini, M.; Wallington, T.; Henry, B.; Low, D.; McDonald, L. C.; Berger, L.; Mederski, B.; Wong, T.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced to Toronto on 23 February, 2003. The outbreak was believed to be over in early May after two incubation periods had passed with no newly identified cases. However, on 20 May, 2003 a cluster of respiratory illnesses occurred in a rehabilitation facility in Toronto. These cases were later identified as SARS but not until a community hospital in which one of these cases was previously hospitalized (Hospital X) had already experienced nosocomial transmission. This report describes the outbreak investigation of nosocomial transmission of SARS at Hospital X. METHODS: An investigation of 90 probable and suspect cases of SARS associated with a hospital outbreak was performed. The investigation included death record reviews, chart reviews, case finding and contact tracing. Nursing cohorts who worked on the specific ward in which nosocomial transmission occurred had work-shift and patient-assignment records reviewed to determine source of infection. RESULTS: The greatest number of cases occurred within hospital employees (42.5%) with an average age of 51 years and 69% being female. The mean incubation period for one time exposure patients was 6.3 days (range 4 to 10 days). Twelve (13.8%) of the cases died. Five of seven nurses who cared for a specific SARS patient during this period acquired SARS. Twelve of 17 (70.6%) nursing staff who developed SARS worked with another nursing staff who was symptomatic for SARS. Staff members who worked the evening shift or the morning shift and therefore likely attended a nursing appreciation breakfast were five times more likely to acquire SARS than those who did not attend. INTERPRETATION: What was believed to be the end of the Toronto SARS outbreak led the Provincial Operations Centre (POC) to issue a directive allowing a more relaxed use of infection-control precautions during the beginning of Phase 2 of the outbreak. These relaxations of precautions were temporally associated with the nosocomial transmission of SARS to hospital staff, other patients and visitors at Hospital X.

METHODS: A retrospective review of work logs and patient assignments, detailed review of medical records of patients with SARS, and comprehensive telephone-based interviews of HCWs who met the case definition for SARS after implementation of infection control precautions. RESULTS: Seventeen HCWs from 6 hospitals developed disease that met the case definition for SARS after implementation of infection control precautions.

Six HCWs (40%) reused items (eg, stethoscopes, goggles, and cleaning equipment) elsewhere on the ward after initial use in a room in which a patient with SARS was staying. Use of masks, gowns, gloves, and eyewear was inconsistent among HCWs. Eight (54%) reported that they were aware of a breach in infection control precautions. HCWs reported fatigue due to an increased number and length of shifts; participants worked a median of 10 shifts during the 10 days before onset of symptoms. Seven HCWs were involved in the intubation of a patient with SARS. One HCW died, and the remaining 16 recovered.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search of all studies related to SARS, including review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization (WHO), and Health Canada Web sites. DATA SYNTHESIS: During the SARS outbreak in Toronto, 438 people had been diagnosed as having suspected or probable SARS and 44 people died. Elderly people and those with comorbid illnesses were at greatest risk of complications or death. Transmission was via direct contact with respiratory secretions. The use of gloves, gowns, N95 masks, and eye protection was effective in preventing transmission. No transmission occurred before symptom onset or after recovery. Serologic tests suggest that antibodies may not appear until 28 days after illness onset. Molecular tests give their greatest yield during the second week of illness. The value of ribavirin treatment remains questionable. The combination of interferon plus corticosteroids appears to be better than corticosteroids alone. Postmortem examination revealed pulmonary edema and evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. Very few morphological changes were noted in other organs despite the presence of viral RNA as detected by polymerase chain reaction.

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS): a critical care perspective,"Manocha, S.; Walley, K. R.; Russell, J. A.","OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, clinical features, etiology, diagnosis, and management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a critical care perspective. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed using the following terms: severe acute respiratory syndrome and SARS virus. Additional information and references were obtained from the Web sites for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and Health Canada. STUDY SELECTION: Recent case series were used to develop a review of the epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and management of patients with SARS from an intensive care unit (ICU) perspective. This was supplemented by epidemiology information obtained from other Web-based sources. Recent published studies describing the etiology of SARS were also included. DATA SYNTHESIS: SARS has rapidly spread from Southeast Asia to numerous countries, including Canada and the United States. A new coronavirus has been isolated and detected from many affected patients. The mortality rate worldwide is approximately 10.5%. From five cohorts, the ICU admission rate ranged from 20% to 38%. Fifty-nine percent to 100% of the ICU patients required mechanical ventilatory support. The mortality rate of SARS patients admitted to the ICU ranged from 5% to 67%. The most common clinical symptoms and signs are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, malaise, and inspiratory crackles. Common laboratory abnormalities included mild leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The chest radiograph pattern ranged from focal infiltrates to diffuse airspace disease. Management consisted of isolation, strict respiratory and contact precautions, ventilatory support as needed, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. Predictors of mortality included advanced age, the presence of comorbidities, and a high lactic dehydrogenase or high neutrophil count at admission.

Traditional ""compartmental"" modeling in epidemiology, however, assumes that population groups are fully mixed, that is, every individual has an equal chance of spreading the disease to every other. Applications of compartmental models to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in estimates of the fundamental quantity called the basic reproductive number R0--the number of new cases of SARS resulting from a single initial case--above one, implying that, without public health intervention, most outbreaks should spark large-scale epidemics. Here we compare these predictions to the early epidemiology of SARS.

Understanding the spatial diffusion process of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Beijing,"Meng, B.; Wang, J.; Liu, J.; Wu, J.; Zhong, E.","OBJECTIVES: To measure the spatial contagion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and to test the different epidemic factors of the spread of SARS in different periods. METHODS: A join-count spatial statistic study was conducted and the given hypothetical processes of the spread of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of 'joins'. RESULTS: The spatial statistics showed that of the six diffusion processes, the highest negative autocorrelation occurred in the doctor-number model (M-5) and the lowest negative autocorrelation was found in the population-amount model (M-3). The results also showed that in the whole 29-day research period, about hour or more days experienced a significant degree of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial analysis is helpful in understanding the spatial diffusion process of an epidemic. The geographical relationships were important during the early phase of the SARS epidemic in Beijing. The statistic based on the number of doctors was significant and more informative than that of the number of hospitals.

Date of origin of the SARS coronavirus strains,"Lu, H.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, J.; Wang, Y.; Li, W.; Zhu, X.; Sun, S.; Xu, J.; Ling, L.; Cai, L.; Bu, D.; Chen, R.","BACKGROUND: A new respiratory infectious epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), broke out and spread throughout the world. By now the putative pathogen of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus, a single positive-strand RNA virus. RNA viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation. It is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus as it spreads through the population. Moreover, finding a date for the last common ancestor of SARS coronavirus strains would be useful for understanding the circumstances surrounding the emergence of the SARS pandemic and the rate at which SARS coronavirus diverge. METHODS: We propose a mathematical model to estimate the evolution rate of the SARS coronavirus genome and the time of the last common ancestor of the sequenced SARS strains. Under some common assumptions and justifiable simplifications, a few simple equations incorporating the evolution rate (K) and time of the last common ancestor of the strains (T0) can be deduced. We then implemented the least square method to estimate K and T0 from the dataset of sequences and corresponding times. Monte Carlo stimulation was employed to discuss the results. RESULTS: Based on 6 strains with accurate dates of host death, we estimated the time of the last common ancestor to be about August or September 2002, and the evolution rate to be about 0.16 base/day, that is, the SARS coronavirus would on average change a base every seven days. We validated our method by dividing the strains into two groups, which coincided with the results from comparative genomics. CONCLUSION: The applied method is simple to implement and avoid the difficulty and subjectivity of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree. Based on 6 strains with accurate date of host death, we estimated a time of the last common ancestor, which is coincident with epidemic investigations, and an evolution rate in the same range as that reported for the HIV-1 virus.",2004,Feb-06,BMC Infect Dis,4,,3,15028113,10.1186/1471-2334-4-3,,#3227,Lu 2004,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2024-02-03 01:19:07)(Included): Further calculations needed to get this number to be comparable to other studies and/or pathogens.

Characterizing Transmission and Control of the SARS Epidemic: Novel Stochastic Spatio-Temporal Models,"Liu, Z.; He, K.; Yang, L.; Bian, C.; Wang, Z.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the first epidemic of the 21st century, has an outbreak history of more than 2 years till today and caused tremendous damage to the human society. Accordingly, many studies on modeling the SARS epidemic have been reported, whereas deficiencies were still lying in those models because of their separate space/time methodology. In this paper, we propose novel comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models from both of the macro aspect and individual aspect for characterizing transmission and control of the SARS disease. Based on a new SARS spread process in consideration of ""suspicious"" population, we firstly establish the stochastic temporal models from two different aspects: the macro model is described with birth-death process and the individual Markov model is described with probability transition matrix (PTM). And then, we amalgamate the deterministic/stochastic population-flow model with the stochastic temporal models together to set up the comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models. Simulations on computer have evaluated the effect of various realistic parameters and control policies, and also have testified the accuracy and efficacy of the new models. Additionally, particular studies on the cases of Tsinghua University and Beijing City are presented. The comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models have considerably reduced the complexity plus errors as compared with previous works and will be able to characterize other various epidemics, e.g. Avian Flu.",2005,,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,7,,7463-9,17282007,10.1109/iembs.2005.1616238,,#3295,Liu 2005,Exclusion reason: No peer review; Christian Morgenstern (2024-01-30 02:05:31)(Select): Conference proceedings; ,
No evidence of over-reporting of SARS in mainland China,"Liu, W.; Han, X. N.; Tang, F.; Borsboom, G. J.; Yang, H.; Cao, W. C.; de Vlas, S. J.","OBJECTIVE: To find out whether there was over-reporting of SARS patients in mainland China in view of the relatively low case fatality ratio in mainland China, in comparison with other affected countries and areas. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all SARS antibody detection papers (in English or Chinese language) using the keywords 'SARS' and 'antibody'. Then the resulting articles were further read through to select the SARS detection results using ELISA methods of serum samples collected at least 1 month after disease onset. A multi-level logistic regression was applied to test for possible differences in the proportions positive between locations of the study. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies were identified, including 39 from mainland China and nine from elsewhere (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and Vietnam). For mainland China, there was no difference between Guangdong, Beijing and other provinces in the proportions testing positive (83.0%, 85.8% and 85.4% respectively). The grand average of 84.2% seropositive was lower than the 95.1% for the countries and areas outside of mainland China combined. However, this difference was far from significant after correcting for dependency of individual tests within the same study. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed no evidence of over-reporting of SARS in mainland China, nor in Guangdong, where the SARS epidemic started.

Prevalence and genetic diversity analysis of human coronaviruses among cross-border children,"Liu, P.; Shi, L.; Zhang, W.; He, J.; Liu, C.; Zhao, C.; Kong, S. K.; Loo, J. F. C.; Gu, D.; Hu, L.","BACKGROUND: More than a decade after the outbreak of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) SARS in Guangdong province and Hong Kong SAR of China in 2002, there is still no reoccurrence, but the evolution and recombination of the coronaviruses in this region are still unknown. Therefore, surveillance on the prevalence and the virus variation of HCoVs circulation in this region is conducted. METHODS: A total of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from cross-border children (<6 years, crossing border between Southern China and Hong Kong SAR) showing symptoms of respiratory tract infection, such as fever (body temperature > 37.5 degrees C), from 2014 May to 2015 Dec. Viral nucleic acids were analyzed and sequenced to study the prevalence and genetic diversity of the four human coronaviruses. The statistical significance of the data was evaluated with Fisher chi-square test. RESULTS: 78 (2.37%; 95%CI 1.8-2.8%) out of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were found to be positive for OC43 (36;1.09%), HKU1 (34; 1.03%), NL63 (6; 0.18%) and 229E (2;0.01%). None of SARS or MERS was detected. The HCoVs predominant circulating season was in transition of winter to spring, especially January and February and NL63 detected only in summer and fall. Complex population with an abundant genetic diversity of coronaviruses was circulating and they shared homology with the published strains (99-100%). Besides, phylogenetic evolutionary analysis indicated that OC43 coronaviruses were clustered into three clades (B,D,E), HKU1 clustered into two clades(A,B) and NL63 clustered into two clades(A,B). Moreover, several novel mutations including nucleotides substitution and the insertion of spike of the glycoprotein on the viral surface were discovered. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate and epidemic trend of coronaviruses were stable and no obvious fluctuations were found. The detected coronaviruses shared a conserved gene sequences in S and RdRp.

SARS transmission pattern in Singapore reassessed by viral sequence variation analysis,"Liu, J.; Lim, S. L.; Ruan, Y.; Ling, A. E.; Ng, L. F.; Drosten, C.; Liu, E. T.; Stanton, L. W.; Hibberd, M. L.","BACKGROUND: Epidemiological investigations of infectious disease are mainly dependent on indirect contact information and only occasionally assisted by characterization of pathogen sequence variation from clinical isolates. Direct sequence analysis of the pathogen, particularly at a population level, is generally thought to be too cumbersome, technically difficult, and expensive. We present here a novel application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based technology in characterizing viral sequence variations that overcomes these problems, and we apply it retrospectively to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The success rate of the MS-based analysis for detecting SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sequence variations was determined to be 95% with 75 copies of viral RNA per reaction, which is sufficient to directly analyze both clinical and cultured samples. Analysis of 13 SARS-CoV isolates from the different stages of the Singapore outbreak identified nine sequence variations that could define the molecular relationship between them and pointed to a new, previously unidentified, primary route of introduction of SARS-CoV into the Singapore population. Our direct determination of viral sequence variation from a clinical sample also clarified an unresolved epidemiological link regarding the acquisition of SARS in a German patient. We were also able to detect heterogeneous viral sequences in primary lung tissues, suggesting a possible coevolution of quasispecies of virus within a single host. CONCLUSION: This study has further demonstrated the importance of improving clinical and epidemiological studies of pathogen transmission through the use of genetic analysis and has revealed the MS-based analysis to be a sensitive and accurate method for characterizing SARS-CoV genetic variations in clinical samples.

The recent global diffusion of SARS highlights the ease in which diseases can diffuse from place to place. Understanding concepts related to medical geography and medical surveillance can help pharmacists be better prepared to anticipate disease diffusion and to evaluate signs of emerging infections.

Approximately 45% of the subsequently infected people resided in Block E, while the other 55% of infected cases mainly resided in six other blocks close to Block E. The distribution of the infected flats in Block E conformed to a non-uniform spatial pattern. Probable environmental causes for airborne transmission associated with the air movements between flats in Block E are identified. The well-established multi-zone airflow modeling method was used to analyze the virus-laden bio-aerosol dispersion between flats through door and window leakage areas in Block E under six different scenarios. The distribution of infection risk in Block E matched with the virus concentrations in flats predicted with the use of multi-zone modeling. Our study shows the importance of ventilation design in high-rise residential apartments. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present study on the Amoy Gardens outbreak presented a scenario in which crowded living spaces might lead to infection disasters. There is a need to improve the current sanitary drainage design and maintenance standards to avoid any leakage of foul gas into the indoor environments. Our study revealed the need for a review of indoor air quality and ventilation design in buildings including offices, homes and hotels. The study has implications to public health in, for example, the control of other airborne respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza, and in bio-terror safety in buildings.",2005,Apr,Indoor Air,15,2,96-111,15737152,10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00318.x,,#3507,Li 2005,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

Symptom combinations associated with outcome and therapeutic effects in a cohort of cases with SARS,"Li, S.; Wang, R.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, X.; Layon, A. J.; Li, Y.; Chen, M.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease and some of its symptoms were clinically indistinguishable of those from similar diseases. This study aimed to find the symptom combinations associated with adverse outcome and the therapeutic effects in a cohort of patients with probable SARS retrospectively. In 2003, 123 SARS cases in Beijing were subjected to a strictly western medicine (WM) treatment, or a combined treatment (WM plus Herba houttuyniae injection, addition of individualized herbal treatments when necessary), of which 115 were followed till death or discharge; 8 were transferred and lost to follow-up. In both treatment groups, clinical manifestations were evaluated daily; development of signs and symptoms, and their possible relationship with outcome, were assessed. The relationships between these sign/symptom complexes and outcome under two treatment protocols were evaluated and differences were noted. Dynamic symptom combinations, dividing into the early, the medium-term and the durational symptom clusters, were identified as likely being related to the adverse outcomes of SARS (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Compared with a strictly WM treatment, the combined treatment resulted in a longer hospital stay (p = 0.028), a non-statistically significant mortality rate decrease (combined treatment: 9.6% versus WM: 11.1%), and a significant improvement of arthralgia and myalgia (p < 0.05) in the early symptom cluster. Additionally, the combined protocol improved arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation significantly at day 22 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the progress and outcome of SARS may be associated with specific temporal patterns of development in combination of several non-specific signs and symptom complexes, which are also helpful for evaluating the therapeutic effects on SARS patients.",2006,,Am J Chin Med,34,6,937-47,17163583,10.1142/s0192415x06004417,,#3533,Li 2006,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Anne Cori (2019-09-10 01:44:53)(Select): paper version from library in Anne's office; ,Treatment

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of ALI/ARDS in patients with SARS-related critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective case series of adult patients with probable SARS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Singapore between March 6 and June 6, 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 28-day mortality after symptom onset. RESULTS: Of 199 patients hospitalized with SARS, 46 (23%) were admitted to the ICU, including 45 who fulfilled criteria for ALI/ARDS. Mortality at 28 days for the entire cohort was 20 (10.1%) of 199 and for ICU patients was 17 (37%) of 46. Intensive care unit mortality at 13 weeks was 24 (52.2%) of 46. Nineteen of 24 ICU deaths occurred late (> or =7 days after ICU admission) and were attributed to complications related to severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, thromboembolic complications, or septicemic shock. ARDS was characterized by ease of derecruitment of alveoli and paucity of airway secretion, bronchospasm, or dynamic hyperinflation. Lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and higher baseline ratios of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen were associated with earlier recovery.

We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. METHODS: We received clinical specimens from patients in seven countries and tested them, using virus-isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to identify a wide range of potential pathogens. RESULTS: None of the previously described respiratory pathogens were consistently identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen. Electron-microscopical examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations, a finding consistent with a point-source outbreak. Indirect fluorescence antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays made with the new isolate have been used to demonstrate a virus-specific serologic response. This virus may never before have circulated in the U.S. population. CONCLUSIONS: A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS.

Pneumothorax and mortality in the mechanically ventilated SARS patients: a prospective clinical study,"Kao, H. K.; Wang, J. H.; Sung, C. S.; Huang, Y. C.; Lien, T. C.","INTRODUCTION: Pneumothorax often complicates the management of mechanically ventilated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in the isolation intensive care unit (ICU). We sought to determine whether pneumothoraces are induced by high ventilatory pressure or volume and if they are associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated SARS patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, clinical study. Forty-one mechanically ventilated SARS patients were included in our study. All SARS patients were sedated and received mechanical ventilation in the isolation ICU. RESULTS: The mechanically ventilated SARS patients were divided into two groups either with or without pneumothorax. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, ventilatory variables such as positive end-expiratory pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation and the accumulated mortality rate at 30 days after mechanical ventilation were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in the pressures and volumes between the two groups, and the mortality was also similar between the groups. However, patients developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation frequently expressed higher respiratory rates on admission, and a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher PaCO2 level during hospitalization compared with those without pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: In our study, the SARS patients who suffered pneumothorax presented as more tachypnic on admission, and more pronounced hypoxemic and hypercapnic during hospitalization. These variables signaled a deterioration in respiratory function and could be indicators of developing pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation in the SARS patients. Meanwhile, meticulous respiratory therapy and monitoring were mandatory in these patients.",2005,Aug,Crit Care,9,4,R440-5,16137358,10.1186/cc3736,,#3830,Kao 2005,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-26 00:20:13)(Select): mortality rate amongst more serious SARS cases; ,

Critical care lessons from severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Lapinsky, S. E.; Granton, J. T.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease that caused large outbreaks in several countries in the first half of 2003, resulting in infection in more than 8000 people and more than 900 deaths. During that time, a large body of literature rapidly emerged describing the clinical disease, the etiologic viral agent, and management options. This paper reviews the current status of this knowledge base, with particular reference to the critically ill patient. RECENT FINDINGS: Case series of patients from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Toronto have characterized the disease with remarkable uniformity. A similarly consistent picture of the SARS patient with respiratory failure has emerged from studies from Toronto and Singapore. Worldwide collaboration led to the rapid identification and gene sequencing of the etiologic virus, SARS-CoV. SUMMARY: SARS is a predominantly respiratory illness, spread through droplets from respiratory secretions and possibly via a fecal-oral route. A small number of ""super-spreaders"" appear to have contributed to the rapid proliferation of the disease. Infection control precautions are an essential component of management. Approximately 20% of patients develop progressive pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure, and the mortality rate is as high as 10%. Treatment strategies with antiviral agents such as ribavirin have not clearly demonstrated a benefit, but high-dose corticosteroids appear to be beneficial in patients with progressive disease. The recent outbreaks highlighted the potential for this disease to overwhelm critical care resources, by the volume of patients and loss of healthcare workers to illness and quarantine.",2004,Feb,Curr Opin Crit Care,10,1,53-8,15166850,,,#3944,Lapinsky 2004,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review

Subsequently, this new tool was applied to provide a better understanding of the entire complement of Taiwanese SARS-CoV isolates, including 20 previously published and 19 identified in this study. The epidemiological data were integrated with the results from the phylogenetic tree and from the nucleotide-signature pattern. RESULTS: The topologies of phylogenetic trees generated by the new and the conventional strategies were similar, with the former having better robustness than the latter, especially in comparison with the maximum-likelihood trees: the new strategy revealed that during 2003 there were 5 waves of epidemic SARS-CoV infection, which belonged to 3 phylogenetic clusters in Taiwan.

In order to better understand evolutionary relationships among SARS coronaviruses (SCoVs) from different international regions, we performed phylogenetic comparisons of full-length genomic and protein sequences from 45 human SCoVs (including 12 from Taiwan) and two civet SCoVs. All the Taiwanese SARS-CoV strains which associated with nosocomial infection formed a monophyletic clade within the late phase of the SARS epidemic. This Taiwanese clade could be further divided into two epidemic waves. Taiwan SCoVs in the first wave clustered with three isolates from the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong indicating their possible origin. Of the 45 human SCoVs, one isolate from Guangdong province, China, exhibited an extra 29-nucleotide fragment between Orf 10 and Orf 11--similar to the civet SCoV genome.

Use of phylogenetics in the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary studies of viral infections,"Lam, T. T.; Hon, C. C.; Tang, J. W.","Since DNA sequencing techniques first became available almost 30 years ago, the amount of nucleic acid sequence data has increased enormously. Phylogenetics, which is widely applied to compare and analyze such data, is particularly useful for the analysis of genes from rapidly evolving viruses. It has been used extensively to describe the molecular epidemiology and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the origins and subsequent evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SCoV), and, more recently, the evolving epidemiology of avian influenza as well as seasonal and pandemic human influenza viruses. Recent advances in phylogenetic methods can infer more in-depth information about the patterns of virus emergence, adding to the conventional approaches in viral epidemiology. Examples of this information include estimations (with confidence limits) of the actual time of the origin of a new viral strain or its emergence in a new species, viral recombination and reassortment events, the rate of population size change in a viral epidemic, and how the virus spreads and evolves within a specific population and geographical region. Such sequence-derived information obtained from the phylogenetic tree can assist in the design and implementation of public health and therapeutic interventions. However, application of many of these advanced phylogenetic methods are currently limited to specialized phylogeneticists and statisticians, mainly because of their mathematical basis and their dependence on the use of a large number of computer programs. This review attempts to bridge this gap by presenting conceptual, technical, and practical aspects of applying phylogenetic methods in studies of influenza, HIV, and SCoV.

In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate.

The high-risk procedures performed and the types of unprotected exposures were recorded for analysis. Only 1 asymptomatic nurse had positive serological test.

Data-model fusion to better understand emerging pathogens and improve infectious disease forecasting,"LaDeau, S. L.; Glass, G. E.; Hobbs, N. T.; Latimer, A.; Ostfeld, R. S.","Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding.

Bayesian reconstruction of disease outbreaks by combining epidemiologic and genomic data,"Jombart, T.; Cori, A.; Didelot, X.; Cauchemez, S.; Fraser, C.; Ferguson, N.","Recent years have seen progress in the development of statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission trees (""who infected whom"") from epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen.

Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS,"Jernigan, J. A.; Low, D. E.; Hefland, R.

No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to healthcare settings.

DATA EXTRACTION: Search strategy of the Cochrane Library, Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, without language restriction, for any intervention to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hygiene). Study designs were randomised trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and controlled before and after studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 2300 titles scanned 138 full papers were retrieved, including 49 papers of 51 studies. Study quality was poor for the three randomised controlled trials and most of the cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of most data except that from six case-control studies. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggest that the spread of respiratory viruses into the community can be prevented by intervening with hygienic measures aimed at younger children. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggests that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52); wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03); wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06); wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41); wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12); and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease the spread of respiratory disease remains uncertain.

M.","BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full papers of 215 studies, to include 66 papers of 67 studies. We included physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, hand hygiene) to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohorts, case-controls, before-after and time series studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used a standardised form to assess trial eligibility. We assessed RCTs by randomisation method, allocation generation, concealment, blinding and follow up. We assessed non-RCTs for potential confounders and classified them as low, medium and high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We included 67 studies including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total number of participants is not included as the total would be made up of a heterogenous set of observations (participant people, observations on participants and countries (object of some studies)). The risk of bias for five RCTs and most cluster-RCTs was high. Observational studies were of mixed quality. Only case-control data were sufficiently homogeneous to allow meta-analysis. The highest quality cluster-RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. Nine case-control studies suggested implementing transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive supportive measures. N95 respirators were non-inferior to simple surgical masks but more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non-significant marginal delay in spread. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure.

The relationship of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus with avian and other coronaviruses,"Jackwood, M. W.","In February 2003, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in Guangdong Province, China, and caused an epidemic that had severe impact on public health, travel, and economic trade. Coronaviruses are worldwide in distribution, highly infectious, and extremely difficult to control because they have extensive genetic diversity, a short generation time, and a high mutation rate. They can cause respiratory, enteric, and in some cases hepatic and neurological diseases in a wide variety of animals and humans. An enormous, previously unrecognized reservoir of coronaviruses exists among animals. Because coronaviruses have been shown, both experimentally and in nature, to undergo genetic mutations and recombination at a rate similar to that of influenza viruses, it is not surprising that zoonosis and host switching that leads to epidemic diseases have occurred among coronaviruses. Analysis of coronavirus genomic sequence data indicates that SARS-CoV emerged from an animal reservoir. Scientists examining coronavirus isolates from a variety of animals in and around Guangdong Province reported that SARS-CoV has similarities with many different coronaviruses including avian coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-like viruses from a variety of mammals found in live-animal markets. Although a SARS-like coronavirus isolated from a bat is thought to be the progenitor of SARS-CoV, a lack of genomic sequences for the animal coronaviruses has prevented elucidation of the true origin of SARS-CoV. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV shows that the 5' polymerase gene has a mammalian ancestry; whereas the 3' end structural genes (excluding the spike glycoprotein) have an avian origin. Spike glycoprotein, the host cell attachment viral surface protein, was shown to be a mosaic of feline coronavirus and avian coronavirus sequences resulting from a recombination event. Based on phylogenetic analysis designed to elucidate evolutionary links among viruses, SARS-CoV is believed to have branched from the modern Group 2 coronaviruses, suggesting that it evolved relatively rapidly. This is significant because SARS-CoV is likely still circulating in an animal reservoir (or reservoirs) and has the potential to quickly emerge and cause a new epidemic.",2006,Sep,Avian Dis,50,3,315-20,17039827,10.1637/7612-042006r.1,,#4152,Jackwood 2006,"Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-20 00:09:33)(Select): has a mutation rate, but it refers to a polymerase in all coronaviruses if I understood correctly; ",Phylogenetic studies

Population mortality during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Toronto,"Hwang, S. W.; Cheung, A. M.; Moineddin, R.; Bell, C.

The objective of this study was to determine if the period of these infection control measures was associated with changes in overall population mortality due to causes other than SARS. METHODS: Observational study of death registry data, using Poisson regression and interrupted time-series analysis to examine all-cause mortality rates (excluding deaths due to SARS) before, during, and after the SARS outbreak. The population of Ontario was grouped into the Greater Toronto Area (N = 2.9 million) and the rest of Ontario (N = 9.3 million) based upon the level of restrictions on delivery of clinical services during the SARS outbreak. RESULTS: There was no significant change in mortality in the Greater Toronto Area before, during, and after the period of the SARS outbreak in 2003 compared to the corresponding time periods in 2002 and 2001. The rate ratio for all-cause mortality during the SARS outbreak was 0.99 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.93-1.06] compared to 2002 and 0.96 [95% CI 0.90-1.03] compared to 2001. An interrupted time series analysis found no significant change in mortality rates in the Greater Toronto Area associated with the period of the SARS outbreak. CONCLUSION: Limitations on access to medical services during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto had no observable impact on short-term population mortality.

F.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognised and highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a new strain of coronavirus. The disease can result in progressive respiratory failure in adults and the mortality rate has been reported to be 8-15%. This infection spreads by droplet transmission and children appear to acquire SARS through close household contact exposure to infected adults. Disease severity is, however, much milder in the paediatric age group. The common laboratory findings in infected children and adolescents include lymphopaenia and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase. Air space consolidation is commonly seen during the course of the illness although chest radiographs are normal on presentation in half of the cases. The pathophysiology of SARS appears to be related to immunological dysregulation in response to the coronavirus infection. The optimal treatment of SARS in children remains to be determined. No case fatality in infected children has been reported. The early and proper isolation of infected adults, meticulous infection control measures in the hospital setting, exhaustive contact tracing and quarantine measures are important steps in preventing the spread of the disease among health care workers and into the community.

"Clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in children","Leung, C. W.; Chiu, W. K.","Children are susceptible to infection by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred specimens. Absence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV beyond 28 days from disease onset generally excludes the diagnosis. The best treatment strategy for SARS among children remains to be determined.

S.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a recent epidemic human disease, is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). First reported in Asia, SARS quickly spread worldwide through international travelling. As of July 2003, the World Health Organization reported a total of 8,437 people afflicted with SARS with a 9.6% mortality rate. Although immunopathological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress, little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood, we identified 52 signature genes that accurately discriminated acute SARS patients from non-SARS controls. While a general suppression of gene expression predominated in SARS-infected blood, several genes including those involved in innate immunity, such as defensins and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, were upregulated. Instead of employing clustering methods, we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots (GAP) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes. Through this method, we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute SARS patients. The rank of SARS severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period (in days) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score. CONCLUSION: The use of the GAP approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems. The severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further elucidating the pathophysiology of their disease.",2005,Sep-21,BMC Genomics,6,,132,16174304,10.1186/1471-2164-6-132,,#4313,Lee 2005,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,
The SARS epidemic in Hong Kong--a human calamity in the 21st century,"Lee, S. H.","PURPOSE: This paper reviews the epidemiology and control measures of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. It sets out proposals for better preparedness to tackle the disease in future. BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) started to strike Hong Kong in March 2003. A total of 1,755 SARS cases with 298 deaths were reported. Prior to the occurrence of the disease in Hong Kong, an intense outbreak of atypical pneumonia was reported in the nearby Guangdong Province in Mainland China. RESULTS: There were three phases in the epidemic. The first phase in March 2003 involved a teaching hospital. The infection originated from a visiting professor from Guangdong, He developed SARS in Hong Kong and died in a Hong Kong hospital. The second phase in April was the spread of the infection from the hospital to the community. The third phase in May was the declining period which ended in June following the removal of Hong Kong from the list of infected areas by WHO. CONCLUSION: Hong Kong was ill-prepared at the early stage of the epidemic. The epidemic produced not only health but also social, economic and humanitarian problems.

Trends in importation of communicable diseases into Singapore,"Lee, G. K.; Tan, K. W.; Goh, K. T.; Wilder-Smith, A.","INTRODUCTION: Singapore is a transition country in Southeast Asia that is both vulnerable and receptive to the introduction and re-introduction of imported communicable diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For a 10-year period between 1998 and 2007 we studied the trend, epidemiological characteristics, proportion of imported versus local transmission of malaria, viral hepatitis (hepatitis A and E), enteric fevers (typhoid and paratyphoid), cholera, chikungunya and SARS. RESULTS: Of a total of 4617 cases of the above selected diseases notified in Singapore, 3599 (78.0%) were imported. The majority of the imported cases originated from Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Malaria constituted the largest bulk (of which 95.9% of the 2126 reported cases were imported), followed by hepatitis A (57.1% of 1053 cases imported), typhoid (87.6% of 596 cases imported), paratyphoid (87.6% of 241 cases imported), and hepatitis E (68.8% of 231 cases imported). Furthermore, there were 14 cases of imported cholera, 6 cases of imported severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 13 cases of imported chikungunya. CONCLUSION: This study underlines that diseases such as malaria, viral hepatitis and enteric fever occur in Singapore mainly because of importation. The main origin of importation was South and Southeast Asia.

Unlike schools in the US, human contacts within Chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of Chinese college students. Simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. Furthermore, the special contact pattern within Chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the US schools. Remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in Chinese colleges during the SARS period. Our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.",2016,Aug-16,Sci Rep,6,,31484,27526868,10.1038/srep31484,,#4408,Huang 2016,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
Short term outcome and risk factors for mortality in adults with critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Hu, X.; Deng, Y.; Wang, J.; Li, H.; Li, M.; Lu, Z.","The independent risk factors to predict mortality of critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were investigated. One hundred and two patients diagnosed with critical SARS were admitted to hospitals of Shanxi Province, from March 7, 2003 to June 4, 2003. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to access their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were studied and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to access the risk factors. The results showed that of the 102 cases, 23 patients died, with a crude mortality rate of 22.5%. Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that age above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 1.10, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.03 to 1.16, P=0.004], lymphopenia at early stage (OR 14.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.97, P=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. On the other side, psychotherapy (OR 0.01, 95 % CI 0.00 to 0.06, P<0.001) was independently associated with aliveness.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Taiwan, 2003","Hsueh, P. R.; Yang, P. C.","In Taiwan, since the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified on February 25, 2003, a total of 3032 cases of suspected or probable SARS were reported prior to July 5, 2003. Among these cases, 664 cases were classified as probable SARS based on the clinical case definitions and 346 had a positive result for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The epidemic in Taiwan could be divided into 2 distinct stages. In stage I (late-February to mid-April) patients had traceable contact with infected patients or travel histories to known affected areas of SARS. By contrast, patients in stage II (mid-April to June) acquired infection via intra-hospital or inter-hospital transmission. The mortality rate directly attributable to SARS during the 2 stages of the outbreak in Taiwan was 11% (37 patients). Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of SARS-CoV strains in Taiwan and other countries showed that Taiwanese strains were closely related to those isolated from patients in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The nonspecific initial symptoms and signs of the illness, the absence of reliable diagnostic tests, as well as the initial lack of strict infection control measures in hospitals and effective national control policies contributed to the island-wide spread of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. Development of an effective strategy to prepare for future outbreaks will require the implementation of an active coordinated clinical reporting system, international collaboration to identify cases in the early stage, development of laboratory tools for early diagnosis, a robust system of prepared isolation, and adequate quarantine facilities.",2005,Apr,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,38,2,82-8,15843851,,,#4440,Hsueh 2005,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

Evidence of the recombinant origin of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus and its implications on the direct ancestor of SARS coronavirus,"Hon, C. C.; Lam, T. Y.; Shi, Z. L.; Drummond, A. J.; Yip, C. W.; Zeng, F.; Lam, P. Y.; Leung, F.

However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs is the descendant of the direct ancestor of SCoV, based on their relatively distant phylogenetic relationship. In this study, evidence of the recombinant origin of the genome of a bat SLCoV is demonstrated. We identified a potential recombination breakpoint immediately after the consensus intergenic sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication intermediates may participate in the recombination event, as previously speculated for other CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an uncharacterized SLCoV lineage that is phylogenetically closer to SCoVs than any of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs. Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.",2008,Feb,J Virol,82,4,1819-26,18057240,10.1128/jvi.01926-07,,#4511,Hon 2008,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen/pathogen epidemiology or transmission not the main focus; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-16 19:31:35)(Select): Has a substitution rate - for SARS-like CoV; ,Phylogenetic studies; Spillover

Viral evolution and the emergence of SARS coronavirus,"Holmes, E.

However, the central processes in the evolution of emerging viruses are unclear, particularly the selection pressures faced by viruses in new host species. We outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence. We emphasize that, although the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide them with great adaptability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases, their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints. Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries. Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses. We show, however, that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for recombination are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineages and that recombination is unlikely to explain the appearance of SARS in humans.",2004,Jul-29,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,359,1447,1059-65,15306390,10.1098/rstb.2004.1478,,#4524,Holmes 2004,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,Phylogenetic studies

DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: A medical center in Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty HCWs. INTERVENTION: NPS examination for the presence of SARS-CoV by two nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV was performed. SARS-CoV was examined by two nested RT-PCRs and a quantitative RT-PCR. Serum-specific antibodies were assessed by enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. We monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non-first-line HCWs. One hundred ninety first-line HCWs and 13 non-first-line HCWs had negative results in both nested RT-PCR assays. Two first-line HCWs who were positive on both nested RT-PCR assays had SARS. They had 16,900 +/- 7,920 copies (mean +/- SD) of RNA per milliliter in the NPS and had detectable anti-SARS antibodies. The remaining 25 first-line HCWs were negative for the first nested RT-PCR but positive for the second nested RT-PCR. Their corresponding titers were 338 +/- 227 copies of RNA per milliliter; antibodies developed in none of these 25 HCWs. The expression and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 were not different among these HCWs. This study shows that colonization of SARS-CoV occurred in 25 of 217 well-protected first-line HCWs on a SARS-associated service, but they remained seronegative. CONCLUSION: With the second RT-PCR assay more sensitive than the first RT-PCR assay, we are able to show that approximately 11.5% of well-protected HCWs exposed to SARS patients or specimens may have colonization without seroconversion.

PURPOSE:
To evaluate whether there is a correlation between the clinical outcomes and radiologic features of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 patients with SARS were analyzed. Three radiologists in consensus retrospectively assessed the frontal chest radiographs obtained at presentation and during treatment (n = 2045) for the distribution (each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones) and extent of lung parenchymal abnormality. Clinical end points included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death.

RESULTS:
Thirty-six (26.1%) patients required ICU care, and eight (5.8%) died. The patients who required ICU care and/or died had more extensive consolidation on chest radiographs obtained initially (median percentage of consolidation, 3.30%, with interquartile range [IR] of 1.70%-8.78% vs 1.70% [IR, 0%-3.30%]; P < .001) and on day 7 after fever onset (median percentage of consolidation, 15.00% [IR, 6.48%-28.73%] vs 5.00% [IR, 2.50%-7.50%]; P < .001) than did surviving patients who did not require ICU care. Patients with involvement of more than one lung zone on initial and day 7 chest radiographs were more likely to require ICU care and/or die than were those with involvement of one or fewer zones (P < .001). Patients with bilateral pneumonic changes at presentation were more likely to have an adverse outcome than were those with unilateral pneumonia (P < .001). Involvement of more than one lung zone at baseline chest radiography was an independent predictor of ICU admission and/or death (odds ratio, 3.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 9.32; P = .037) after adjustments for other significant factors (ie, patient age, and baseline neutrophil count and lactate dehydrogenase level).

More extensive airspace disease at presentation is an independent predictor of adverse outcome in patients with SARS; ",
Severe acute respiratory syndrome vs. the Middle East respiratory syndrome,"Hui, D. S.; Memish, Z. A.; Zumla, A.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review compares the clinical features, laboratory aspects and treatment options of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). RECENT FINDINGS: Bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs) and are likely the reservoir of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although a small number of camels have been found to have positive nasal swabs by real-time polymerase chain reaction and to carry antibody against MERS-CoV, the transmission route and the intermediary animal source remain uncertain amongst the sporadic primary cases. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may cause severe respiratory failure and extrapulmonary features such as diarrhoea, whereas mild or asymptomatic cases also occur in both conditions. In comparison with SARS, patients with MERS are older with male predominance, more comorbid illness and relatively lower human-to-human transmission potential. Although the viral kinetics of MERS-CoV remain unknown, nosocomial infections of MERS occur early within the first week of illness of the index case, whereas those of SARS occurred mainly in the second week of illness when the patient's upper airway viral load peaks on day 10 of illness. In-vitro data suggest that interferon (IFN) with or without ribavirin and mycophenolic acid may inhibit MERS-CoV, whereas protease inhibitors and IFN have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. SUMMARY: Although there are some similarities in the clinical features, MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly than SARS. The higher case fatality rate of MERS is likely related to older age and comorbid illness. More studies are needed to understand MERS-CoV in order to guide public health infection control measures and treatment.",2014,May,Curr Opin Pulm Med,20,3,233-41,24626235,10.1097/mcp.0000000000000046,,#4639,Hui 2014,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-19 19:27:06)(Select): Useful references; ,SARS review; Treatment

An overview on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Hui, D. S.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease that has caught the medical profession by surprise in 2003. The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea but diarrhea occurs in 40-70% of patients after hospital admission. Respiratory failure is the major complication of SARS; at least half of the patients require supplemental oxygen during the acute phase whereas about 20% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support. In contrast, the severity is generally mild in infected young children. Due to our limited understanding of this new disease, treatment of SARS was empirical in 2003. Protease inhibitor (Lopinavir/ritonavir) in combination with ribavirin may play a role as antiviral therapy in the early phase whereas nelfinavir is a promising alternative. The role of interferon and systemic steroid in preventing immune-mediated lung injury deserves further investigation. In addition, other anti-viral treatment, RNA interference, monoclonal antibody, synthetic peptides, and vaccines are being developed. Rapid diagnosis, early isolation, and good infection control measures are important in preventing spread of the infection.",2005,Sep,Monaldi Arch Chest Dis,63,3,149-57,16312205,10.4081/monaldi.2005.632,,#4650,Hui 2005,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Sangeeta Bhatia (2024-01-30 02:04:55)(Included): Excluded as review.; ,Intervention; SARS review; Treatment
Modeling and public health emergency responses: lessons from SARS,"Glasser, J. W.; Hupert, N.; McCauley, M. M.; Hatchett, R.","Modelers published thoughtful articles after the 2003 SARS crisis, but had limited if any real-time impact on the global response and may even have inadvertently contributed to a lingering misunderstanding of the means by which the epidemic was controlled. The impact of any intervention depends on its efficiency as well as efficacy, and efficient isolation of infected individuals before they become symptomatic is difficult to imagine. Nonetheless, in exploring the possible impact of quarantine, the product of efficiency and efficacy was varied over the entire unit interval. Another mistake was repeatedly fitting otherwise appropriate gamma distributions to times to event regardless of whether they were stationary or not, particularly onset-isolation intervals whose progressive reduction evidently contributed to SARS control. By virtue of their unknown biology, newly-emerging diseases are more challenging than familiar human scourges. Influenza, for example, recurs annually and has been modeled more thoroughly than any other infectious disease. Moreover, models were integrated into preparedness exercises, during which working relationships were established that bore fruit during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. To provide the most accurate and timely advice possible, especially about the possible impact of measures designed to control diseases caused by novel human pathogens, we must appreciate the value and difficulty of policy-oriented modeling. Effective communication of insights gleaned from modeling SARS will help to ensure that policymakers involve modelers in future outbreaks of newly-emerging infectious diseases. Accordingly, we illustrate the increasingly timely care-seeking by which, together with increasingly accurate diagnoses and effective isolation, SARS was controlled via heuristic arguments and descriptive analyses of familiar observations.",2011,Mar,Epidemics,3,1,32-7,21420657,10.1016/j.epidem.2011.01.001,,#4673,Glasser 2011,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Anne Cori (2019-09-09 20:04:09)(Select): paper version from library in Anne's office - it's a review with some additional analyses but as far as I can see no original estimates of parameters of interest; ,SARS review

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A residential care home for the elderly in Hong Kong with a local outbreak of SARS. PARTICIPANTS: Residents and staff in the residential care home who had contact with three patients with SARS (residents A and B, and staff C). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood samples were tested for total antibodies to SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence antibody test. The transmission of SARS was elucidated based on information from standardised questionnaires, and records of investigation and surveillance by the Department of Health. RESULTS: Among the 90 eligible residents, three died, one moved out, and 19 refused to participate. Of the 32 eligible staff, six refused to participate. None of the remaining 93 participants tested positive for antibody to SARS-CoV. Based on the chronological order, resident A might have transmitted infection to resident B and staff C. Sitting close to the bathroom doorway while resident A took a shower was the only contact of resident B with resident A. The only opportunity for staff C to have contact with body fluids/excreta of resident A was in the handling of rubbish from the resident's room.

Perspectives on the basic reproductive ratio,"Heffernan, J. M.; Smith, R. J.; Wahl, L.

Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models.

As its pathogen was identified as a new kind of coronavirus (SARS_CoV), its genome was quickly sequenced on several isolates. Studies on its functional genomics were performed by combinatorial application of all the available bioinformatics tools and the development of new programs. In this way, it was found that the four proteins were absolutely responsible for nosogenesis of SARS, i.e. spike (S) protein; small envelop (E) protein; membrane (M) protein; and nucleocaspid (N) protein. Molecular evolution studies have revealed that SARS must be originated from wild animals, and it was demonstrated that the major genetic variations in some critical genes, particularly the Spike gene, was essential for the transition from animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission. Theoretical models, either Logistic model or SIR model, were developed to describe the transmission of SARS. The recorded difference of SARS spreading in Beijing and Hong Kong was also reasonably analyzed according to these models.

The outbreak, initiated by a traveler to Hong Kong in late February 2003, led to sequential spread of SARS to three major acute care hospitals in Singapore. The critical factor in containing this outbreak was early detection and complete assessment of movements and follow-up of patients, healthcare workers, and visitors who were contacts. Visitor records were important in helping identify exposed persons who could carry the infection into the community. In the three hospital outbreaks, three different containment strategies were used to contain spread of infection: closing an entire hospital, removing all potentially infected persons to a dedicated SARS hospital, and managing exposed persons in place. On the basis of this experience, if a nosocomial outbreak is detected late, a hospital may need to be closed in order to contain spread of the disease.

Identification and containment of an outbreak of SARS in a community hospital,"Dwosh, H. A.; Hong, H. H.; Austgarden, D.; Herman, S.; Schabas, R.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is continuing to spread around the world. All hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with SARS. Thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. We describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with SARS admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in Richmond Hill, Ont., and the response to a SARS outbreak within our institution. METHODS: We collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable SARS. The index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) from a referral hospital on Mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of SARS in Toronto. After 13 days in the ICU, a diagnosis of probable SARS was reached for our index case. Immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. Aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time. RESULTS: During the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected SARS, in addition to our index case.

Effect of human movement on airborne disease transmission in an airplane cabin: study using numerical modeling and quantitative risk analysis,"Han, Z.; To, G. N.; Fu, S. C.; Chao, C. Y.; Weng, W.; Huang, Q.","BACKGROUND: Airborne transmission of respiratory infectious disease in indoor environment (e.g. airplane cabin, conference room, hospital, isolated room and inpatient ward) may cause outbreaks of infectious diseases, which may lead to many infection cases and significantly influences on the public health. This issue has received more and more attentions from academics. This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission. METHODS: The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The dose-response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants. The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions. An in-flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation. A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors. A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system. RESULTS: The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols, significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin. The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered. The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers. CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important. For future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control.",2014,Aug-06,BMC Infect Dis,14,,434,25098254,10.1186/1471-2334-14-434,,#5411,Han 2014,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Juliette Unwin (2024-01-26 03:54:32)(Included): Not a transmission model; ,

Geographical spread of SARS in mainland China,"Fang, L. Q.; de Vlas, S. J.; Feng, D.; Liang, S.; Xu, Y. F.; Zhou, J. P.; Richardus, J. H.; Cao, W. C.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the spatiotemporal diffusion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in mainland China, and to analyse the spatial pattern of SARS transmission from the Beijing epicentre to its neighbouring areas. METHODS: Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo-coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a 'case-control' design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel-related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. RESULTS: The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter-provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter-provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association.

Clinical and laboratory features in the early stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Fan, C. K.; Yieh, K. M.; Peng, M. Y.; Lin, J. C.; Wang, N. C.; Chang, F. Y.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical and laboratory features of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early stage and to compare them with those of patients initially suspected of having SARS who were later determined to have other febrile diseases. METHODS: Between March and June 2003, 122 patients with possible SARS were admitted to the isolation ward of Tri-Service General Hospital. SARS was diagnosed according to the modified World Health Organization case definition (May 1, 2003). Among them, 43 were classified as probable SARS cases and a SARS etiology was excluded in 32 patients. RESULTS: Presenting symptoms on admission included fever (97.7% of probable cases, 84.4% of excluded cases), chills (39.5% vs 18.8%), cough with sputum production (16.3% vs 40.6%), dry cough (23.3% vs 9.4%), dyspnea (18.6% vs 9.4%), diarrhea (14.0% vs none), rhinorrhea (2.3% vs none), and myalgia (7.0% vs 6.6%). Common laboratory features included lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and creatine kinase values. Intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in 12 probable cases and 6 excluded cases. Five patients with probable SARS (11.6%) died. A scoring system which was developed to differentiate SARS patients from other febrile patients in the emergency room could differentiate probable cases from excluded cases with a sensitivity of 36.4% and a specificity of 70.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation and laboratory features at the early stage do not allow differentiation of patients with SARS-CoV infection from other febrile patients.

D.","CONTEXT: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease attributed to a novel coronavirus, occurred in Singapore during the first quarter of 2003 and led to 204 patients with diagnosed illnesses and 26 deaths by May 2, 2003. Twenty-one percent of these patients required admission to the medical intensive care unit. During this period, the Center for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore, performed a total of 14 postmortem examinations for probable and suspected SARS. Of these, a total of 8 were later confirmed as SARS infections. OBJECTIVE: Our series documents the difficulties encountered at autopsy during the initial phases of the SARS epidemic, when the pattern of infection and definitive diagnostic laboratory criteria were yet to be established. DESIGN: Autopsies were performed by pathologists affiliated with the Center for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore. Tissue was accessed and read at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, and at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC. Autopsy tissue was submitted to the Virology Department, Singapore General Hospital, for analysis, and in situ hybridization for the SARS coronavirus was carried out at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 patients showed features of diffuse alveolar damage. In 8 patients, no precipitating etiology was identified, and in all of these patients, we now have laboratory confirmation of coronavirus infection. Two of the 8 patients presented at autopsy as sudden unexpected deaths, while the remaining 6 patients had been hospitalized with varying lengths of stay in the intensive care unit. In 3 patients, including the 2 sudden unexpected deaths, in situ hybridization showed the presence of virally infected cells within the lung. In 4 of the 8 SARS patients, pulmonary thromboemboli were also recognized on gross examination, while one patient had marantic cardiac valvular vegetations. CONCLUSIONS: It is unfortunate that the term atypical pneumonia has been used in conjunction with SARS. Although nonspecific by itself, the term does not accurately reflect the underlying dangers of viral pneumonia, which may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome. We observed that the clinical spectrum of disease as seen in our autopsy series included sudden deaths.

DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive cohort study. SETTING: A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Children younger than 18 yrs with SARS. RESULTS: Twenty-one children were included, with a mean age of 10.7 +/- 5.1 yrs. Children with SARS presented with fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, chills, headache, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Examination of the chest showed minimal auscultatory findings. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild elevations of activated partial thromboplastin time, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase. Bacteriologic and virologic studies were all negative for common pathogens. Unilateral focal opacity was the commonest finding in chest radiography. High-resolution computerized tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic tool if the chest radiograph was negative. The clinical course was less severe in comparison with adult patients. However, adolescents (age, > or =12 yrs) resembled adults in their clinical features. When compared with the younger age group, the adolescents had significantly higher temperatures, more constitutional upset, and a greater need for steroid treatment. Children younger than 12 yrs seemed less ill but had more coughing. On the whole, the outcome was favorable.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as an agent of emerging and reemerging infection,"Cheng, V. C.; Lau, S. K.; Woo, P. C.; Yuen, K.

The discovery of this virus was soon followed by the discovery of the civet and bat SARS-CoV and the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Surveillance of coronaviruses in many animal species has increased the number on the list of coronaviruses to at least 36. The explosive nature of the first SARS epidemic, the high mortality, its transient reemergence a year later, and economic disruptions led to a rush on research of the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease. This research resulted in over 4,000 publications, only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article. The marked increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return.

While a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which must be considered at an individual level. Our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective HAI outbreak control and prompt responses. Our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components - time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation - and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. We conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold.",2018,Oct-03,J Med Syst,42,11,222,30284042,10.1007/s10916-018-1085-4,,#5670,Cheng 2018,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2023-12-22 01:40:11)(Select): model for nosocomial transmission based on a ward which had SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 but the paper has no actual connection to SARS-CoV-1; ,

Effect of integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine on the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome: A meta-analysis,"Chen, Y.; Guo, J. J.; Healy, D. P.; Zhan, S.","BACKGROUND: Data regarding the treatment efficacy of integrative treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western Medicine (WM) in treating patients with (SARS) are conflicting. The effects of integrative TCM/WM treatment have not been fully quantified. OBJECTIVES: To systematically asses the treatment effects of integrated TCM with WM versus WM alone in patients with SARS, incorporating data from recently published studies. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted, using published randomized and nonrandomized controlled clinical studies that compared the treatment effects of integrative TCM/WM with WM alone from 2002 to 2006. The outcome measurements included mortality rate, cure rate, resolution of pulmonary infiltrate, use of corticosteroid, and time to defervescence. The effect sizes were presented as risk ratio (RR), rate difference (RD), and weighted mean difference (WMD). The pooled effect sizes were calculated by both fixed-effects and random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 1,678 patients with a diagnosis of SARS were identified, including 866 patients from 16 randomized controlled studies and 812 patients from 8 nonrandomized controlled studies. There were no differences detected in mortality rate or cure rate between treatments. Compared with patients receiving WM treatment alone, patients receiving integrative treatment were more likely to have complete or partial resolution of pulmonary infiltrate (RD=0.18, 95%CI; 0.07 to 0.30), lower average daily dosage (mg) of corticosteroid (WMD=-60.27, 95% CI; -70.58 to -49.96), higher CD4+ counts (cells/uL) (WMD=167.96, 95% CI; 109.68 to 226.24), and shorter time to defervescence (days) (WMD= -1.06, 95%CI;-1.60 to -0.53). CONCLUSIONS: The experience of integrative TCM/WM in the treatment of SARS is encouraging.

The objective of this study is to identify the clinical risk factors of SARS and to develop a scoring system for early diagnosis. METHODS: The detailed clinical data of all patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature higher than 38.0 degrees C (100.3 degrees F), documented at home or at the ED, and risks of exposure to SARS within 14 days were assessed. The diagnosis of probable SARS was made according to the definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Items with significant differences among symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests on presentation between SARS and non-SARS groups were determined and used to develop the scoring system. RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled and 8 were diagnosed as probably having SARS. None of the initially discharged patients or their relatives developed SARS. Compared with the non-SARS group, the SARS group was younger (33.9+/-15.9 years versus 44+/-9.8 years; P=.02), had a higher percentage of fever prolonged more than 5 days (87.5% versus 6.5%; P<.01), myalgia (75% versus 27.4%; P=.01), and diarrhea (50% versus 9.7%; P=.02); had less occurrence of cough before or during fever (0% versus 64.5%; P=.01); and had lower absolute lymphocyte (0.9+/-0.3x10(9)/L versus 1.5+/-1.1x10(9)/L; P<.01) and platelet counts (144.1+/-36.3x10(9)/L versus 211.6+/-78.8x10(9)/L; P=.02).

Impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome care on the general health status of healthcare workers in taiwan,"Chen, N. H.; Wang, P. C.; Hsieh, M. J.; Huang, C. C.; Kao, K. C.; Chen, Y. H.; Tsai, Y. H.","BACKGROUND: The impact of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was enormous, but few studies have focused on the infectious and general health status of healthcare workers (HCWs) who treated patients with SARS. DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated the general health status of HCWs during the SARS epidemic. The Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 Survey was given to all HCWs immediately after caring for patients with SARS and 4 weeks after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts. Tests for detection of SARS coronavirus antibody were performed for HCWs at these 2 time points and for control subjects during the SARS epidemic. SETTING: Tertiary care referral center in Taipei, Taiwan. SUBJECTS: Ninety SARS-care task force members (SARS HCWs) and 82 control subjects. RESULTS: All serum specimens tested negative for SARS antibody. Survey scores for SARS HCWs immediately after care were significantly lower than those for the control group (P<.05 by the t test) in 6 categories. Vitality, social functioning, and mental health immediately after care and vitality and mental health after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts were among the worst subscales. The social functioning, role emotional, and role physical subscales significantly improved after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts (P<.05, by paired t test). The length of contact time (mean number of contact-hours per day) with patients with SARS was associated with some subscales (role emotional, role physical, and mental health) to a mild extent. The total number of contact-hours with symptomatic patients with SARS was a borderline predictor (adjusted R2=0.069; P=.038) of mental health score.

Modelling the utility of body temperature readings from primary care consults for SARS surveillance in an army medical centre,"Chen, M. I.; Tan, I. B.; Ng, Y. Y.","INTRODUCTION: There is interest in surveillance systems for outbreak detection at stages where clinical presentation would still be undifferentiated. Such systems focus on detecting clusters of syndromes in excess of baseline levels, which may indicate an outbreak. We model the detection limits of a potential system based on primary care consults for the detection of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from an averaged-sized medical centre were extracted from the Patient Care Enhancement System (PACES) [the electronic medical records system serving the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)]. Thresholds were set to 3 or more cases presenting with particular syndromes and a temperature reading of >or=38oC (T >or=38). Monte Carlo simulation was used to insert simulated SARS outbreaks of various sizes onto the background incidence of febrile cases, accounting for distribution of SARS incubation period, delay from onset to first consult, and likelihood of presenting with T >or=38 to the SAF medical centre. RESULTS: Valid temperature data was available for 2,012 out of 2,305 eligible syndromic consults (87.2%). T >or=38 was observed in 166 consults (8.3%). Simulated outbreaks would peak 7 days after exposure, but, on average, signals at their peak would consist of 10.9% of entire outbreak size. Under baseline assumptions, the system has a higher than 90% chance of detecting an outbreak only with 20 or more cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance based on clusters of cases with T >or=38 helps reduce background noise in primary care data, but the major limitation of such systems is that they are still only able to confidently detect large outbreaks.",2006,Apr,Ann Acad Med Singapore,35,4,236-41,16710493,,,#5740,Chen 2006,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Thomas Rawson (2024-01-30 23:33:51)(Included): Not a transmission model; Anne Cori (2019-08-22 02:36:56)(Select): model for outbreak detection; ,Containability

It may progress to respiratory failure, and a significant proportion of patients die. Preliminary data suggest that a high viral load of the SARS coronavirus is associated with adverse outcomes in the intensive care unit, but the relation of viral load to survival is unclear. METHODS: We prospectively studied an inception cohort of 133 patients with virologically confirmed SARS who were admitted to 2 general acute care hospitals in Hong Kong from Mar. 24 to May 4, 2003.

RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (24.1%) met the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 24 patients (18.0%) died. The following baseline factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61-80 years) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03-13.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44-7.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log10 increase in number of RNA copies per millilitre, 95% CI 1.06-1.39).

Most cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have occurred in close contacts of SARS patients. However, in Beijing, a large proportion of SARS cases occurred in persons without such contact. We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls matched for age group and sex. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have chronic medical conditions or to have visited fever clinics (clinics at which possible SARS patients were separated from other patients), eaten outside the home, or taken taxis frequently. The use of masks was strongly protective. Among 31 case-patients for whom convalescent-phase (>21 days) sera were available, 26% had immunoglobulin G to SARS-associated coronavirus. Our finding that clinical SARS was associated with visits to fever clinics supports Beijing’s strategy of closing clinics with poor infection-control measures. Our finding that mask use lowered the risk for disease supports the community’s use of this strategy.; ",

Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the details of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes. As of 10 May 2003, a cumulative 7296 probable SARS cases with 526 deaths have been reported from 30 countries on three continents (WHO, ProMED). In the past week, more than 1000 new probable cases and 96 deaths were reported globally. This represents an increase of 119 new cases and 8 new deaths compared with 9 May 2003 (China (85), Taiwan (23), and Hong Kong (7) represented the overwhelming majority, with one additional case each reported from France, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States). Only in China, as of 10 May 2003 (WHO) total of 4884 with 235 deaths have been reported.

Intubation of SARS patients: infection and perspectives of healthcare workers,"Caputo, K. M.; Byrick, R.; Chapman, M. G.; Orser, B. J.; Orser, B. A.","PURPOSE: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 presented major challenges to the safety of anesthesiologists and other healthcare workers (HCWs). This study determined the incidence of SARS transmission to HCWs who intubated patients and analyzed the concerns of HCWs regarding personal and patient safety. METHODS: Healthcare workers who performed tracheal intubation in 10 Toronto hospitals were identified using the Ontario Public Health database. A questionnaire was used to collect information from the HCWs. To determine if the patterns of personal protection or concerns changed over time, data were analyzed according to whether the intubation occurred during SARS 1 (February 23 to April 21) or SARS 2 (April 22 to July 1). RESULTS: Thirty-three HCWs who performed 39 intubations on 35 SARS patients were interviewed. Three of 23 HCWs (13%) acquired SARS during SARS 1 whereas none (0/10) acquired SARS during SARS 2. Personal protection increased from SARS 1 to SARS 2 and HCWs' concerns changed over time. During SARS 1, concerns focused on the need for personal protective equipment whereas during SARS 2, concerns focused on the need for strict training and patient care protocols. HCWs perceived that their experiences were ineffectively integrated into risk management protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Protection guidelines failed to completely prevent the transmission of SARS to HCWs. Nine percent of the interviewed HCWs who intubated patients contracted SARS. A Risk Analysis Framework is presented to facilitate the rapid integration of HCWs' experiences into practice guidelines.",2006,Feb,Can J Anaesth,53,2,122-9,16434750,10.1007/bf03021815,,#6096,Caputo 2006,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Anne Cori (2019-06-27 22:21:49)(Select): they measure incidence but just as numbers no confidence intervals and no statistical analysis comparing between different groups so I decided to exclude; ,

The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in mainland China dissected,"Cao, W. C.; de Vlas, S. J.; Richardus, J. H.","This paper provides a review of a recently published series of studies that give a detailed and comprehensive documentation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in mainland China, which severely struck the country in the spring of 2003. The epidemic spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas. Reanalysis of all available epidemiological data resulted in a total of 5327 probable cases of SARS, of whom 343 died. The resulting case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries or areas, and this difference could only partly be explained by younger age of patients and higher number of community acquired infections. Analysis of the impact of interventions demonstrated that strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response was the most important factor to control SARS in mainland China, whereas the most stringent control measures were all initiated when the epidemic was already dying down. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited, much consumption was merely postponed, but for Beijing irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector were considerable. An important finding from a cohort study was that many former SARS patients currently suffer from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of the treatment with corticosteroids during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable information and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.",2011,Mar-08,Infect Dis Rep,3,1,e2,24470901,10.4081/idr.2011.e2,,#6103,Cao 2011,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-18 20:44:41)(Select): Useful review; ,SARS review
The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of a moderately contagious disease,"Camitz, M.; Liljeros, F.","BACKGROUND: Much research in epidemiology has been focused on evaluating conventional methods of control strategies in the event of an epidemic or pandemic. Travel restrictions are often suggested as an efficient way to reduce the spread of a contagious disease that threatens public health, but few papers have studied in depth the effects of travel restrictions. In this study, we investigated what effect different levels of travel restrictions might have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: We used a stochastic simulation model incorporating survey data of travel patterns between municipalities in Sweden collected over 3 years. We tested scenarios of travel restrictions in which travel over distances >50 km and 20 km would be banned, taking into account different levels of compliance. RESULTS: We found that a ban on journeys >50 km would drastically reduce the speed and geographical spread of outbreaks, even when compliance is < 100%. The result was found to be robust for different rates of intermunicipality transmission intensities. CONCLUSION: This study supports travel restrictions as an effective way to mitigate the effect of a future disease outbreak.",2006,Dec-14,BMC Med,4,,32,17166291,10.1186/1741-7015-4-32,,#6122,Camitz 2006,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

DESIGN: Statistical method. DATA: The daily reported number of SARS and interventions taken by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) up to 24 June 2003 are used. METHOD: To use a back projection technique to construct the infection curve of SARS in Hong Kong. The estimated epidemic curve is studied to identify the major events and to assess the effectiveness of interventions over the course of the epidemic. RESULTS: The SARS infection curve in Hong Kong is constructed for the period 1 March 2003 to 24 June 2003. Some interventions seem to be effective while others apparently have little or no effect. The infections among the medical and health workers are high. CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine of the close contacts of confirmed and suspected SARS cases seems to be the most effective intervention against spread of SARS in the community. Thorough disinfection of the infected area against environmental hazards is helpful.

SETTING: Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China RESULTS: The outbreak started with a visitor from southern China on 21 February. At the hospitals where the first cases were treated the disease spread quickly among healthcare workers, and then out into the community as family members became infected. By 1 April, 685 cases had been reported with 16 deaths. Symptoms include high fever and one or more respiratory symptoms (including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing). Changes in lung tissue suggest that part of the lung damage is due to cytokines induced by the microbial agent, which has led to empirical treatment with corticosteroids, broad spectrum antiviral agent, and antibacterial cover. There is strong evidence that a novel coronavirus is the pathogen. Precautions for droplet infection should be instituted, including the wearing of masks and rigorous disinfection and hygiene procedures. On 27 March the Department of Health announced drastic measures, including vigorous contact tracing and examination, quarantine of contacts in their homes, and closure of all schools and universities.

SARS: epidemiology,"Chan-Yeung, M.; Xu, R. H.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Southern China in November 2002, and was brought to Hong Kong in February 2003. From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case fatality rate of 11%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at high risk and accounted for one-fifth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2-10). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptomatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome and critical care medicine: the Toronto experience,"Booth, C. M.; Stewart, T. E.","BACKGROUND: The 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) provided numerous challenges to the delivery of critical care. The Toronto critical care community has learned important lessons from SARS, which will help in preparation for future disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to review the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the Toronto SARS outbreak, the challenges SARS provided to the delivery of critical care, and how we would like to be better organized for a similar challenge in the future. FINDINGS: SARS manifests clinically as atypical pneumonia and ranges in severity from minor nonspecific symptoms to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Approximately 20% of patients with SARS will become critically ill and require admission to the intensive care unit. ARDS develops in the majority of these patients. Mortality from ARDS in SARS is high, and outcome is associated with the presence of comorbid disease and the severity of illness at presentation. The influx of critically ill patients and the transmission of SARS to front line workers created a tremendous strain on Toronto's healthcare system. From a critical care perspective, the most important limitation in the response to SARS was the absence of a coordinated leadership and communication infrastructure. Other challenges encountered during SARS include the following: closure of intensive care unit beds and loss of staff through quarantine and illness, implementing novel infection control protocols, educating staff, conducting research to learn about SARS, system planning, and maintaining staff morale during this very difficult period. CONCLUSIONS: Communication and leadership strategies were key components in the critical care response to SARS. Ideally, centers should have systems in place to allow for the rapid expansion and modification of critical care services in the event of a disease outbreak. Other critical care communities should consider their crisis response strategies in advance of similar events.",2005,Jan,Crit Care Med,33,1 Suppl,S53-60,15640680,,,#6331,Booth 2005,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-18 20:30:05)(Select): Useful review; Anne Cori (2019-06-26 23:29:55)(Select): review things like CFR; ,SARS review
Quantifying the impact of community quarantine on SARS transmission in Ontario: estimation of secondary case count difference and number needed to quarantine,"Bondy, S. J.; Russell, M. L.; Lafleche, J. M.; Rea, E.","BACKGROUND: Community quarantine is controversial, and the decision to use and prepare for it should be informed by specific quantitative evidence of benefit. Case-study reports on 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks have discussed the role of quarantine in the community in transmission. However, this literature has not yielded quantitative estimates of the reduction in secondary cases attributable to quarantine as would be seen in other areas of health policy and cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Using data from the 2003 Ontario, Canada, SARS outbreak, two novel expressions for the impact of quarantine are presented. Secondary Case Count Difference (SCCD) reflects reduction in the average number of transmissions arising from a SARS case in quarantine, relative to not in quarantine, at onset of symptoms. SCCD was estimated using Poisson and negative binomial regression models (with identity link function) comparing the number of secondary cases to each index case for quarantine relative to non-quarantined index cases. The inverse of this statistic is proposed as the number needed to quarantine (NNQ) to prevent one additional secondary transmission. RESULTS: Our estimated SCCD was 0.133 fewer secondary cases per quarantined versus non-quarantined index case; and a NNQ of 7.5 exposed individuals to be placed in community quarantine to prevent one additional case of transmission in the community. This analysis suggests quarantine can be an effective preventive measure, although these estimates lack statistical precision. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to other health policy areas, literature on quarantine tends to lack in quantitative expressions of effectiveness, or agreement on how best to report differences in outcomes attributable to control measure. We hope to further this discussion through presentation of means to calculate and express the impact of population control measures. The study of quarantine effectiveness presents several methodological and statistical challenges. Further research and discussion are needed to understand the costs and benefits of enacting quarantine, and this includes a discussion of how quantitative benefit should be communicated to decision-makers and the public, and evaluated.",2009,Dec-24,BMC Public Health,9,,488,20034405,10.1186/1471-2458-9-488,,#6335,Bondy 2009,"Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Thomas Rawson (2024-01-26 01:34:35)(Included): They present ""differences in secondary attack rates"" but not the SARs themselves!

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection in Toronto children: a second look,"Bitnun, A.; Read, S.; Tellier, R.; Petric, M.; Richardson, S. E.","OBJECTIVES: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2003, there was an impetus to provide clinical information to the medical community in a timely manner. Accordingly, a preliminary report of our experience of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infections in children was published without microbiological findings. This report provides an update on pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infections in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that includes microbiological findings. METHODS: All of the children admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children between March 14 and June 15, 2003, with suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection were included. A proven case was defined as one that fulfilled the clinical criteria for suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection and demonstrated a serologic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Serology results, from a neutralizing antibody assay, were considered positive if the sera inhibited the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-specific cytopathic effect at a dilution of > or =1:8. RESULTS: Neutralizing antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was demonstrated in 8 of 25 children admitted with suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection. In 3 of these 8 children, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was also detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in the stool. All 8 had documented exposure to > or =1 severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-infected adults residing in the same household. Exposure that was limited to visiting a Toronto hospital at which severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-infected patients were admitted or travel from a country in which severe acute respiratory syndrome had been reported did not result in documented infection in any of our cases. On the basis of our clinical case definition, 6 of 8 microbiologically confirmed case had been classified as having probable severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection. Clinical disease was mild, nonspecific, and self-limited and was indistinguishable from that reported with other common respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The factor most strongly associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection in Toronto children was a history of close contact with an adult severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus case.

L.; Matlow, A.; Kitai, I.; Tellier, R.; Richardson, S.; Manson, D.; Babyn, P.; Read, S.","OBJECTIVE: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in the greater Toronto area between February and June 2003. We describe the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic features of children who were admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, with a presumptive diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS. METHODS: A prospective investigational study protocol was established for the management of children with a presumptive diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS. All were ultimately classified as having probable SARS, suspect SARS, or another cause on the basis of their epidemiologic exposure, clinical and radiologic features, and results of microbiologic investigations. RESULTS: Twenty-five children were included; 10 were classified as probable SARS and 5 were classified as suspect SARS, and in 10 another cause was identified. The exposure consisted of direct contact with at least 1 adult probable SARS case in 11 children, travel from a World Health Organization-designated affected area in Asia in 9 children, and presence in a Toronto area hospital in which secondary SARS spread had occurred in 5 children. The predominant clinical manifestations of probable cases were fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. With the exception of 1 teenager, none of the children developed respiratory distress or an oxygen requirement, and all made full recoveries. Mild focal alveolar infiltrates were the predominant chest radiograph abnormality. Lymphopenia; neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; and elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase were present in some cases. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the SARS-associated coronavirus by an in-house reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all 25 children. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that SARS is a relatively mild and nonspecific respiratory illness in previously healthy young children. The presence of fever in conjunction with a SARS exposure history should prompt one to consider SARS as a possible diagnosis in children irrespective of the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms.

A systematic review was undertaken to help inform pandemic influenza guidance in the United Kingdom. The initial review was performed in November 2009 and updated in June 2010 and January 2011. Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental and observational studies of humans published in English with an outcome of laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed influenza and other viral respiratory infections. There were 17 eligible studies. Six of eight randomised controlled trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups (masks with or without hand hygiene; N95/P2 respirators). One household trial found that mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza-like illness/laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction. One hospital-based trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with non-fit-tested N95 respirator use compared with medical masks. Eight of nine retrospective observational studies found that mask and/or respirator use was independently associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Findings, however, may not be applicable to influenza and many studies were suboptimal. None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection. Some evidence suggests that mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection especially hand hygiene.

Identification of new respiratory viruses in the new millennium,"Berry, M.; Gamieldien, J.; Fielding, B. C.","The rapid advancement of molecular tools in the past 15 years has allowed for the retrospective discovery of several new respiratory viruses as well as the characterization of novel emergent strains. The inability to characterize the etiological origins of respiratory conditions, particularly in children, led several researchers to pursue the discovery of the underlying etiology of disease. In 2001, this led to the discovery of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and soon following that the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) promoted an increased interest in coronavirology and the latter discovery of human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. Human bocavirus, with its four separate lineages, discovered in 2005, has been linked to acute respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal complications. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) represents the most recent outbreak of a completely novel respiratory virus, which occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and presents a significant threat to human health.

Theory versus data: how to calculate R0?,"Breban, R.; Vardavas, R.; Blower, S.","To predict the potential severity of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS, HIV, TB and smallpox, a summary parameter, the basic reproduction number R(0), is generally calculated from a population-level model. R(0) specifies the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. R(0) is used to assess the severity of the outbreak, as well as the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control. Conventionally, it is assumed that if R(0)>1 the outbreak generates an epidemic, and if R(0)<1 the outbreak becomes extinct. Here, we use computational and analytical methods to calculate the average number of secondary infections and to show that it does not necessarily represent an epidemic threshold parameter (as it has been generally assumed). Previously we have constructed a new type of individual-level model (ILM) and linked it with a population-level model. Our ILM generates the same temporal incidence and prevalence patterns as the population-level model; we use our ILM to directly calculate the average number of secondary infections (i.e., R(0)). Surprisingly, we find that this value of R(0) calculated from the ILM is very different from the epidemic threshold calculated from the population-level model. This occurs because many different individual-level processes can generate the same incidence and prevalence patterns. We show that obtaining R(0) from empirical contact tracing data collected by epidemiologists and using this R(0) as a threshold parameter for a population-level model could produce extremely misleading estimates of the infectiousness of the pathogen, the severity of an outbreak, and the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control.",2007,Mar-14,PLoS One,2,3,e282,17356693,10.1371/journal.pone.0000282,,#6573,Breban 2007,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen/pathogen epidemiology or transmission not the main focus; Isobel Routledge (2019-05-25 02:30:19)(Select): no SARs data used; ,
Interhuman transmissibility of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk,"Breban, R.; Riou, J.; Fontanet, A.","BACKGROUND: The new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS. METHODS: We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data. RESULTS: With our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0.69 (95% CI 0.50-0.92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0.80 (0.54-1.13). Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0.60 (0.42-0.80). Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1--ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

A.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently recognized condition of viral origin associated with substantial morbidity and mortality rates in adults. Little information is available on its radiologic manifestations in children. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize the radiographic presentation of children with SARS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We abstracted data (n=62) on the radiologic appearance and course of SARS in pediatric patients with suspect (n=25) or probable (n=37) SARS, diagnosed in five hospital sites located in three cities: Toronto, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Available chest radiographs and thoracic CTs were reviewed for the presence of the following radiographic findings: airspace disease, air bronchograms, airways inflammation and peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients (suspect=25, probable=37) were evaluated for SARS. Patient ages ranged from 5.5 months to 17 years and 11.5 months (average, 6 years and 10 months) with a female-to-male ratio of 32:30. Forty-one patients (66.1%) were in close contact with other probable, suspect, or quarantined cases; 10 patients (16.1%) had recently traveled to WHO-designated affected areas within 10 days; and 7 patients (11.2%) were transferred from other hospitals that had SARS patients. Three patients, who did not have close/hospital contact or travel history to affected areas, were classified as SARS cases based on their clinical signs and symptoms and on the fact that they were living in an endemic area. The most prominent clinical presentations were fever, with a temperature over 38 degrees C (100%), cough (62.9%), rhinorrhea (22.6%), myalgia (17.7%), chills (14.5%), and headache (11.3%). Other findings included sore throat (9.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (9.7%), rigor (8.1%), and lethargy (6.5%). In general, fever and cough were the most common clinical presentations amongst younger pediatric SARS cases (age<10 years), whereas, in addition to these symptoms, headache, myalgia, sore throat, chills, and/or rigor were common in older patients (age>/=10 years). The chest radiographs of 35.5% of patients were normal. The most prominent radiological findings that were observed in the remaining patients were areas of consolidation (45.2%), often peripheral with multifocal lesions in 22.6%. Peribronchial thickening was noted on chest radiographs of 14.5% of patients. Pleural effusion was observed only in one patient (age 17 years and 11.5 months), whereas interstitial disease was not observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: In pediatric cases, SARS manifests with nonspecific radiographic features making radiological differentiation difficult, especially from other commonly encountered childhood respiratory viral illnesses causing airspace disease. The radiographic presentation of suspected SARS cases ranged from normal to mild perihilar peribronchial thickening.

Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process.

[Prevention and control of infectious diseases with pandemic potential: the EU-project SARSControl],"Ahmad, A.; Krumkamp, R.; Richardus, J. H.; Reintjes, R.","INTRODUCTION: The influenza pandemics of the 20th century, the SARS epidemic in 2002/03 and the growing number of human cases infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus clearly demonstrate that the threat of new pandemics is very real. These events have intensified pandemic prevention and control activities worldwide. ""SARSControl"" is a three-year project funded by the European Commission with the objective to aid European member states in the public health management of new emerging infections. This article summarises the main research results and recommendations arising from this project. METHOD: The reports and papers published in the SARSControl project form the basis of this article. In addition, a literature search for SARS and pandemic influenza was conducted and information on pandemic planning and management guidelines obtained from the WHO and EU websites. The project results are discussed in this context. RESULTS: A lack of knowledge and delayed international communication resulted in the rapid spread of SARS, highlighting the importance of a global system for rapid and transparent information transfer. Epidemiological and economic modelling studies have shown that, in comparison to travel restrictions, applying intervention measures to interrupt local transmission within a country and investing into vaccine research and anti-viral stockpiling, is a more cost-effective and efficient use of resources for the containment of pandemics. A study investigating the perceived threat associated with pandemics showed that the subjective risk perception of people varies among countries. This influences human behaviour and should hence be considered during risk communication and implementation of pandemic control measures. DISCUSSION: The basic prerequisites of an efficient pandemic management are operationalisable pandemic plans, subjected to regular exercises, backed by adequate resources and a sound health-care infrastructure. At international level cross-border co-operation and information exchange on infection control is the key to pandemic mitigation and containment. Strengthening surveillance systems at the international level, to allow the timely monitoring of infectious agents and outbreaks is essential. Transferring such outbreak information in real time into mathematical models and the resulting essential epidemiological information to policy makers would facilitate a more efficient use of scarce resources.

"Prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus in animal traders--Guangdong Province, China, 2003",,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified in 2003 as an infectious disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the coronavirus family not observed previously in humans. Because its sequence data differ from that of known human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is suspected to have crossed the species barrier between an animal host and humans. The SARS outbreak began in China's Guangdong Province, where approximately 1,500 probable cases were identified during November 2002-June 2003. Detection of SARS-like coronavirus has been reported previously in masked palm civets (sometimes called civet cats) and a raccoon dog for sale in a live animal market in Shenzhen municipality. This report summarizes results of an investigation conducted by public health authorities in Guangdong Province, which compared the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV IgG antibody in animal traders (i.e., workers in live animal markets) with that of persons in control groups. The results indicated that 13% of the animal traders, none of whom had SARS diagnosed, had IgG antibody to SARS-CoV, compared with 1%-3% of persons in three control groups. Although the results provide indirect support for the hypothesis of an animal origin for SARS, they also underscore the need for detailed patient histories and more focused animal studies to confirm an animal origin for SARS.",2003,Oct-17,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,52,41,986-7,14561956,,,#6762,,Exclusion reason: No peer review; ,

"Efficiency of quarantine during an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome--Beijing, China, 2003",,"During March--July 2003, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, China, accounted for 2,521 probable cases (attack rate: 19 per 100,000 population). To control the epidemic, public health officials initiated enhanced surveillance, isolation of SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by health-care workers, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients. Approximately 30,000 Beijing residents were quarantined in their homes or quarantine sites. To guide future quarantine policy, the Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program (China FETP) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) conducted a survey to estimate the risk for acquiring SARS among quarantined residents of Haidian District (2001 population: 2.24 million), Beijing, in May 2003, 1 month after the epidemic peaked.

"[SARS: diagnosis, therapy, and especially prevention]","Agolini, G.; Raitano, A.; Viotti, P. L.; Vitali, M.; Zorzut, F.","The main purpose of this review is to analyze some aspects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, in order to obtain useful data to suggest preventive actions to reduce the spreading of the disease. Many elements have been examined to reach some conclusions and to allow an updated discussion. Surgical masks protect more the patient than the caregiver. Simple or double surgical masks may be useful, as double gloving protects the hands of the surgical personnel against percutaneous transmission of HIV eventually present in contaminated blood. The frequent substitution of the external masks with a new one will improve the filtering activity against droplets produced by cough or sneezes of the patient. The use of respiratory masks may be suggested in hospitals or in restricted ventilated areas where, even if coronavirus variant is considered an environmental contaminant more than a respiratory risk, droplets nuclei may persist in the air and add consistent dangers to the heath-care givers. Considering that large and medium droplets may infect floors and surfaces, in addition to gloves, gowns, masks and eyes protection, the available list of viral and bacterial factors implicated in SARS ethiology suggests a better hand antisepsis using frequently the alcohol based gels (containing an high percentage of emollients substances), if available. A liquid soap with triclosan can also be used, if the health-care workers compliance to hand washing increases, as expected in this explosive situation. On the basis of the results of some experimental data, the environmental disinfection may be effected with ethyl alcohol 70% in water. Disinfection of floors or larger surfaces may be obtained with chlorine compounds solutions, after an accurate pre-cleaning.

The urban geography of SARS: paradoxes and dilemmas in Toronto's health care,"Affonso, D. D.; Andrews, G. J.; Jeffs, L.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has impacted heavily on both Canada's society and its health care system. Quite unexpectedly, hospitals and health care workers became facilitators of disease diffusion. This experience has demonstrated the need for a comprehensive disease control strategy. AIMS: The aims are threefold. First, to examine the subtle and changing spatial characteristics of SARS during the short but critical period of its rapid spread in the Greater Toronto Area. Second, to make salient three paradoxes, and their associated dilemmas, faced by nurses and other health care professionals challenged with caring for the sick and containing the rapid spread of the disease. Third, to propose some ways of approaching these dilemmas, as well as some broader preventative and mitigating strategies. METHODS: The crosscutting concepts of 'clinical uncertainty' and 'flow of human contacts' are used to explain disease transmission characteristics and urban spatial diffusion and to guide the particular strategies developed. Evidence for the paper comes from public health records, governmental and non-governmental health statements and the initial epidemiological research on SARS. Direct insights are also gained from recent first-hand experiences of Toronto's health care system during the crisis. DISCUSSION: The concepts of clinical uncertainty and the flow of human contacts provide in-depth insights that complement the findings of large-scale epidemiological studies, and help operationalize their general calls for enhanced control measures. The comprehensive disease control strategy proposed includes the creation of a hospital infrastructure specific to the containment of biological threats; an advisory coalition of disease control specialists; the development of a biological threat-and-containment simulation laboratory and three specific programmes in patient safety, risk assessment and community mobilization. CONCLUSION: It is argued that containment alone, while a necessary and urgent priority, cannot be seen as an end in itself and might better be understood as one possible trajectory within a comprehensive problem-solving strategy. The experiences in Toronto may offer insights to other cities and countries that currently lack such strategies and hence may be vulnerable to similar outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases.",2004,Mar,J Adv Nurs,45,6,568-78,15012634,,,#6830,Affonso 2004,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Isobel Routledge (2019-05-24 03:54:49)(Select): some relevant metrics but all secondary sources ; ,

Strategies adopted and lessons learnt during the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis in Singapore,,"In Singapore, the military was actively involved in the containment of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) last year. The outbreak started in February 2003 with three Singapore travellers to Hong Kong. At that time, nothing was known about the aetiological agent of the atypical pneumonia that was termed SARS. Unfortunately one of the travellers was a super-spreader, defined as a person with high efficiency for virus transmission, and was responsible for the expansion of the national outbreak. Not only was the Singapore military involved in contact tracing of personnel and enforcement of home quarantine, military-affiliated research institutes were also involved in providing diagnostic support. This review reconstructs the events that took place during the SARS outbreak, focusing on the special support arising from complementing the military-affiliated laboratory with the public health laboratory. A description of the diagnostic findings is provided in chronological order.

This probability-concept-based prediction uses the convective transfer mechanism of virus-containing airborne aerosols to track inversely the most probable locations of infection sources according to the concentration value measured in certain location(s). A new approach is proposed to convert the number of infection cases to the concentration values of virus particles that can be used as the input for prediction, making the concentration measurement unnecessary for source tracking in a real outbreak of epidemic disease. The source-tracking method is demonstrated and verified by using the SARS infection cases of medical students in a hospital ward outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003.

Modeling respiratory illnesses with change point: A lesson from the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong,"Wong, H.; Shao, Q. X.; Ip, W. C.","It is generally agreed that respiratory disease is closely related to ambient air quality and weather conditions. Besides, hygiene related factors such as the public health measures by the government and possible personal awareness in the community can also affect the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. However, there is no quantitative support for this conclusion, because of lack of quality data. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered strict public health measures and personal awareness in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases, providing us an opportunity to quantify the impact of hygiene related factors in the spread of the disease. In this paper, we model the number of the respiratory illnesses by a semiparametric model which models the environmental and weather impacts using a multiple index model and the impact of other public health measures and possible personal awareness using a growth curve with jump. Using data from Hong Kong, we found that public health measures contributed to about 39% of reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses during the SARS period. However, the impact of hygienically related factors eventually fades as time passes. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the usefulness of governmental campaigns to arouse the awareness of the public in staying away from transmission of respiratory diseases during the full outbreak of the disease. The results also show the fast fading of alertness of Hong Kong people towards the epidemic. Furthermore, our model also offers a way to model the impacts of environmental factors on respiratory diseases, when the data contains the effect of human intervention, by introducing the change point and growth curve to remove such an effect.

Here, adopting permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability, we study the predictability of a diverse collection of outbreaks and identify a fundamental entropy barrier for disease time series forecasting. However, this barrier is often beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We show that forecast horizons vary by disease and that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are likely mechanisms for differences in predictability. Our results highlight the importance of embracing dynamic modeling approaches, suggest challenges for performing model selection across long time series, and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.",2019,Feb,Nat Commun,10,,,WOS:000459403800003,10.1038/s41467-019-08616-0,,#8448,Scarpino 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen/pathogen epidemiology or transmission not the main focus; ,SARS review
Modeling strategies for containing an invading infection,"Roberts, M. G.","An integral equation model of Kermack-McKendrick type is proposed for describing the dynamics of an infectious disease invading a susceptible population. Modifications of the model, including control strategies based on the isolation of infectious individuals and targeted vaccination, are described. In the model the incidence of infection is structured according to the location of exposure, and para-meterization requires some knowledge of the infectivity kernel and the initial rate of exponential increase of cases. The model was motivated by the risk to a community from the global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and the prospect of future epidemics of emerging infections.

Small world and scale free model of transmission of SARS,"Small, M.; Tse, C. K.",We model transmission of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in Hong Kong with a complex small world network. Each node in the network is connected to its immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically isolated nodes. Transmission can only occur along these links. We find that this model exhibits dynamics very similar to those observed during the SARS outbreak in 2003. We derive an analytic expression for the rate of infection and confirm this expression with computational simulations. An immediate consequence of this quantity is that the severity of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 was due to ineffectual infection control in hospitals (i.e. nosocomial transmission). If all infectious individuals were isolated as rapidly as they were identified the severity of the outbreak would have been minimal.,2005,May,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,15,5,1745-1755,WOS:000230974100014,10.1142/s0218127405012776,,#8760,Small 2005,"Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2024-02-20 18:17:17)(Select): same model and data as #8759, nothing new; ",

The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and ""superspreaders"". Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that ""super-spreaders"" may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to 3-5 days the extent of the SARS epidemic would have been minimal.

Spatial distribution of infection risk of SARS transmission in a hospital ward,"Qian, H.; Li, Y. G.; Nielsen, P. V.; Huang, X. H.","The classical Wells-Riley model for predicting risk of airborne transmission of diseases assumes a uniform spatial distribution of the infected cases in an enclosed space. A new mathematical model is developed here for predicting the spatial distribution of infection risk of airborne transmitted diseases by integrating the Wells-Riley equation into computational fluid dynamics. We applied our new integrated model to analyze a large nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemics, which was studied in the literature with regard to the association between airflow and SARS infection. The predicted numbers of infected cases of medical students in the same cubicle, the adjacent cubicle and the distant cubicle were 6.39, 0.78 and 0.2 respectively while the observed numbers of infected medical students in the three cubicles were 7, 0 and 0 respectively during the morning of March 6th, which was the highest attack period. The predicted numbers of infected cases of inpatients during the morning of March 6th in the same cubicle, the adjacent cubic and the distance cubicle were 7.8, 5.1, and 4.8 respectively which also agree well with the observed distribution of the infected inpatients during the entire infection period. The new developed model provides a new modelling tool for investigating the airborne transmission of diseases in enclosed spaces.

"Mathematical study of the impact of quarantine, isolation and vaccination in curtailing an epidemic","Podder, C. N.; Gumel, A. B.; Bowman, C. S.; McLeod, R. G.","The quarantine of suspected cases and isolation of individuals with symptoms are two of the primary public health control measures for combating the spread of a communicable emerging or re-emerging disease. Implementing these measures, however, can inflict significant socio-economic and psychological costs. This paper presents a deterministic compartmental model for assessing the single and combined impact of quarantine and isolation to contain an epidemic. Comparisons are made with a mass vaccination program. The model is simulated using parameters for influenza-type diseases such as SARS. The study shows that even for an epidemic in which asymptomatic transmission does not occur, the quarantine of asymptomatically-infected individuals can be more effective than only isolating individuals with symptoms, if the associated reproductive number is high enough. For the case where asymptomatic transmission occurs, it is shown that isolation is more effective for a disease with a small basic reproduction number and transmission coefficient of asymptomatically-infected individuals. If asymptomatic individuals transmit at a rate that is at least 20% that of symptomatic individuals, quarantine is always more effective. The study further shows that the reduction in disease burden obtained from a combined quarantine and isolation program can be comparable to that obtained by a vaccination program, if the former is implemented quickly enough after the onset of the outbreak. If the implementation of such a quarantine/isolation program is delayed, however, even for a short while, its effectiveness decreases rapidly.",2007,Jun,Journal of Biological Systems,15,2,185-202,WOS:000248241500006,10.1142/s0218339007002180,,#9037,Podder 2007,Exclusion reason: No FT found; Anne Cori (2019-09-10 18:26:38)(Select): paper copy in Anne's office; ,

We used these multi-patch, flux-based models to determine how the time course of infected and susceptible populations depends on the disease parameters, the geometry of the migrations between the patches, and the addition of infected people into a patch. We found that there are significantly longer lived transients and additional ""ancillary"" epidemics when the reproductive rate R is closer to 1, as would be typical of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and bird flu, than when R is closer to 10, as would be typical of measles.

Pandemic Human Coronavirus - characterization and comparison of selected properties of HCoV-SARS and HCoV-MERS,"Pancer, K. W.","Two Coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, causing generally mild respiratory tract infections in humans, were described in the XX c. Pandemic Coronaviruses were first discovered as late as in the XXI c.: SARS-HCoV in 2002 - causing severe respiratory tract infections (SARS) in China; MERS-HCoV in 2012 - circulating mostly on the Arabian Peninsula. The SARS epidemic ended in 2004 resulting in morbidity of > 8000 and > 770 deaths, while the MERS epidemic is still ongoing (> 2000 ill, > 700 deaths) although its intensity decreased. Both viruses are zoonotic and require at least two ""host jumps"" for the transmission of the infection to humans: for HCoV-SARS - from bat to palm civet and then to human; for HCoV-MERS - from bats to camels and subsequently to humans. Primary mode of transmission is droplet in close contact (< 1 m), but both viruses remain active in aerosol (up to 24 h), so infection can be also spread by air (ventilation). The ability for human-to-human transmission is higher for HCoV-SARS than for HCoV-MERS (8 generations vs. 4, respectively). Moreover, there are differences in genome structure and pathogenic mechanisms: different receptor, cell entry mechanism, different way of host response modulation (e.g. inhibition of IFN beta cascade), etc. Probably, these differences influence the overall manifestation of the disease in humans. Infection caused by HCoV-MERS might manifest itself as ARDS, a mild-mannered and asymptomatic disease. HCoV-SARS infections seem to be associated with severe disease only. In this paper, a comparison of the structure of these viruses, the mechanisms underlying their ability to cross the interspecies barrier and to multiply in the human body, including modulation of IFN beta cascade, as well as routes of infection transmission and symptoms caused, were presented.",2018,Jan-Mar,Postepy Mikrobiologii,57,1,22-32,WOS:000429634500004,,,#9226,Pancer 2018,Exclusion reason: Non-english; ,

Outbreak detection model based on danger theory,"Mohsin, M. F. M.; Abu Bakar, A.; Hamdan, A. R.","In outbreak detection, one of the key issues is the need to deal with the weakness of early outbreak signals because this causes the detection model to have has less capability in terms of robustness when unseen outbreak patterns vary from those in the trained model. As a result, an imbalance between high detection rate and low false alarm rate occurs. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel outbreak detection model based on danger theory; a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens. We propose a signal formalization approach based on cumulative sum and a cumulative mature antigen contact value to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Two outbreak diseases, dengue and SARS, are subjected to a danger theory algorithm; namely the dendritic cell algorithm. To evaluate the model, four measurement metrics are applied: detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy. From the experiment, the proposed model outperforms the other detection approaches and shows a significant improvement for both diseases outbreak detection. The findings reveal that the robustness of the proposed immune model increases when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. The model is able to detect new unknown outbreak patterns and can discriminate between outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high detection rate, high sensitivity, and lower false alarm rate even without a training phase.

A novel computational method for characterizing and analyzing genomic sequences with applications to phylogenetic analysis for SARS-associated coronavirus,"Megherbi, D.; Kostem, E.; Callaos, N.; Lesso, W.; Nomura, S.; Zhang, J.","As it is known, the SARS virus is mutating very rapidly. This made diagnosis of related diseases and the discovery of vaccines against said virus more difficult. In recent articles [7] [8] in science magazine, the SARS virus was sequenced and analyzed. In these articles, the computational methods used to compare SARS to other coronaviri were based on statistical techniques. In this paper we discuss the limitations of such statistical methods and the need for more accurate and computationally efficient methods to characterize the SARS among other coronaviri. In particular, in statistical methods important information, such as the location of blocks of similarities in a given sequence, is not a factor taken into account in the calculation of global sequence similarity scores. We present here a novel technique to uniquely and compactly represent the SARS and the other coronavirus sequences. In a previous work [1] (2] through a mapping process, we demonstrated the ability to 1) recognizes, shapes, and 2) concisely represent shape of large data using a set of coefficients derived in the mapping process. In [13-17] we have demonstrated how this method was applied to fingerprint, object representation and recognition, facial and large data representation and recognition. In this work we illustrate how these previous results can be applied to DNA sequence data Phylogenetic and similarity analysis. In the approach outlined herein, a syntactic representation of DNA sequences is formed as polygonal shapes from which we extract a compact set of coefficients uniquely representing the DNA sequence. Additionally, we present and show how the size of the sequence data does not affect the computational performance of the proposed technique. We also show how the proposed compact sequence representation is highly sensitive to minor changes such as a single mutation or SNP change, which makes the proposed technique very accurate in comparison to current statistically, based methods. Additionally, we show how the proposed technique allows the effect of ""gaps"" between the aligned matching blocks to be taken into account. More importantly, we show how adding the information, such as the nucleotide positions and the spacing between these blocks affect the similarity score. This information is very interesting for the phylogenic studies of genes, and organisms.

Contact Tracing in Healthcare Digital Ecosystems for Infectious Disease Control and Quarantine Management,"Leong, K. I.; Si, Y. W.; Biuk-Aghai, R. P.; Fong, S.; Ieee,","Highly infectious diseases such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), Small Pox, and currently Swine Flu, to name but a few, pose a significant threat to the global population. Detection and prevention of infectious diseases is notoriously complex and problematic due to the ever increasing number of international travellers. In addition, the risk of being infected with an infectious disease in densely populated urban areas tends to be much higher compared to rural areas. When an outbreak occurs, the detection of source of infection (or index case), clusters of cases and transmission routes in a rapid manner is crucial in preventing the infectious disease from further spreading. Contact tracing has proven to be helpful for these detections. Traditionally, contact tracing is a field work of the medical personnel with little assistance of IT (Information Technology), if any. During the worldwide outbreak of SARS in 2003, HCIS (Health Care Information Systems) were built to facilitate contact tracing. However, contact tracing, and thus the detection process, is not a fully automatic process in these systems. In this paper, with SARS as a case study, we realize detection as an automatic process by applying algorithms and data mining techniques in the patients' activities and social interaction together with characteristics of the infectious disease.",2009,,,,,346-351,WOS:000279101500061,,,#10139,Leong 2009,Exclusion reason: No peer review; Anne Cori (2019-09-11 02:52:24)(Select): conference paper; ,

Overview on SARS in Asia and the world,"Lam, W. K.; Zhong, N. S.; Tan, W. C.","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the first major novel infectious disease to hit the international community in the 21st century. It originated in southern China in November 2002, reached Hong Kong in February 2003 and spread rapidly thereafter to 29 countries/regions on five continents. At the end of the epidemic, the global cumulative total was 8098 with 774 deaths. Seven Asian countries/regions were among the top ten on the list. Mainland China and Hong Kong, SAR, accounted for 87% of all cases and 84% of all deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by a novel coronavirus. It has alarmed the world with its infectivity and significant morbidity and mortality, its lack of a rapid, reliable diagnostic test and lack of effective specific treatment and vaccination. The adverse impact on travel and business around the world, particularly in Asia, has been enormous. Some lessons learnt from this epidemic included: (1) any outbreak of infectious disease can rapidly spread around the world by air travel; (2) early reporting of the outbreak to neighbouring countries/regions and the World Health Organization is essential to prevent international spread; and (3) infection control, tracing and quarantine of contacts are essential to control the epidemic. Many questions remain unanswered, including the origin and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, the natural history and the best specific treatment of the disease. The SARS-CoV has probably jumped from an animal host to humans. There is an urgent need to evaluate the human-animal habitat in southern China and to remove animal reservoirs if found.",2003,Nov,Respirology,8,,S2-S5,WOS:000187345100002,10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00516.x,,#10202,Lam 2003,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review

N.","Context Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is anew clinical entity for which no effective therapeutic strategy has been developed. Objective To provide preliminary results on the potential therapeutic benefit and tolerability of interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids for SARS. Design, Setting, and Patients Open-label study of 22 patients diagnosed as having probable SARS at North York General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, between April 11 and May 30, 2003. Interventions Thirteen patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and 9 patients were treated with corticosteroids plus subcutaneous interferon alfacon-1. Main Outcome Measures Clinical parameters, including oxygen saturation and requirement, laboratory measures, and serial chest radiography results. Results Resolution of fever and lymphopenia were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Of the 13 patients treated with corticosteroids alone, 5 (38.5%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 3 (23.1 %) required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and 1 (7.7%) died. Of the 9 patients in the interferon alfacon-1 treatment group, 3 (33.3 %) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 1 (11.1 %) required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and none died. The interferon alfacon-1 treatment group had a shorter time to 50% resolution of lung radiographic abnormalities (median time, 4 days vs 9 days; P=.001), had, better oxygen saturation (P=.02), resolved their need for supplemental oxygen more rapidly (median, 10 days vs 16 days; P=.02), had less of an increase in creatine kinase levels (P=.03), and showed a trend toward more rapid resolution of lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with the group receiving corticosteroids alone. Conclusions In this preliminary, uncontrolled study of patients with SARS, Use of interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids was associated with reduced disease-associated impaired oxygen saturation, more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities, and lower levels of creatine kinase. These findings suggest that further investigation may be warranted to determine the role of interferon alfacon-1 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS.",2003,Dec,Jama-Journal of the American Medical Association,290,24,3222-3228,WOS:000187499300026,10.1001/jama.290.24.3222,,#10219,Loutfy 2003,Exclusion reason: Case report/case study; ,

Methods The data of all probable SARS cases were derived from the Infectious Disease Reporting System of the Center of Diseases Control and Hospital Information Systems, during the 2003 epidemic in mainland China. The definition of probable SARS case was consistent with the definition for clinically confirmed SARS issued by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association of CFR with age, sex, residence location, occupation, the period of the epidemic and the duration from symptom onset to admission into hospital. Results The overall CFR was 6.4% among 5327 probable SARS cases in mainland China. Old age, being a patient during the early period of a local outbreak, and being from Tianjin led to a relatively higher CFR than young age, late stage of a local outbreak and cases from Beijing. Guangdong Province resulted in an even lower CFR compared with Beijing. Conclusions Because of their deteriorated health status and apparent complications, SARS patients aged > 60 years had a much higher risk of dying than younger patients. At the early stage of local outbreaks, lack of experience in patient care and perhaps treatment also led to a relatively higher CFR. The Tianjin SARS outbreak happened mainly within a hospital, leading to a high impact of co-morbidity.

Artificial infectious disease optimization: A SEIQR epidemic dynamic model-based function optimization algorithm,"Huang, G. Q.","To solve some complicated function optimization problems, an artificial infectious disease optimization algorithm based on the SEIQR epidemic model is constructed, it is called as the SEIQR algorithm, or SEIQRA in short. The algorithm supposes that some human individuals exist in an ecosystem; each individual is characterized by a number of features; an infectious disease (SARS) exists in the ecosystem and spreads among individuals, the disease attacks only a part of features of an individual. Each infected individual may pass through such states as susceptibility (S), exposure (E), infection (I), quarantine (Q) and recovery (R). State 5, E, I, Q and R can automatically and dynamically divide all people in the ecosystem into five classes, it provides the diversity for SEIQRA; that people can be attacked by the infectious disease and then transfer it to other people can cause information exchange among people, information exchange can make a person to transit from one state to another; state transitions can be transformed into operators of SEIQRA; the algorithm has 13 legal state transitions, which corresponds to 13 operators; the transmission rules of the infectious disease among people is just the logic to control state transitions of individuals among S, E, I, Q and R, it is just the synergy of SEIQRA, the synergy can be transformed into the logic structure of the algorithm. The 13 operators in the algorithm provide a native opportunity to integrate many operations with different purposes; these operations include average, differential, expansion, chevy, reflection and crossover. The 13 operators are executed equi-probably; a stable heart rhythm of the algorithm is realized. Because the infectious disease can only attack a small part of organs of a person when it spreads among people, the part variables iteration strategy (PVI) can be ingeniously applied, thus enabling the algorithm to possess of high performance of computation, high suitability for solving some kinds of complicated optimization problems, especially high dimensional optimization problems. Results show that SEIQRA has characteristics of strong search capability and global convergence, and has a high convergence speed for some complicated functions optimization problems.

Three typical spatial information parameters including working unit/address, onset location and reporting unit were selected and SARS epidemic spread in-out flow in Beijing was defined based on the SARS epidemiological investigation data in China from 2002 to 2003 while its epidemiological characteristics were discussed. Furthermore, by the methods of spatial-temporal statistical analysis and network characteristic analysis, spatial-temporal high-risk hotspots and network structure characteristics of Beijing outer in-out flow were explored, and spatial autocorrelation/heterogeneity, spatial-temporal evolutive rules and structure characteristics of the spread network of Beijing inner in-out flow were comprehensively analyzed. The results show that (1) The outer input flow of SARS epidemic in Beijing concentrated on Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, but the outer output flow was disperse and mainly includes several north provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong. And the control measurement should focus on the early and interim progress of SARS breakout. (2) The inner output cases had significant positive autocorrelative characteristics in the whole studied region, and the high-risk population was young and middle-aged people with ages from 20 to 60 and occupations of medicine and civilian labourer.

Moreover, the input/output transmission networks of the SARS epidemic are built according to the definition of in-out flow. The spatiotemporal distribution of the SARS in-out flow, spatial distribution and temporal change of node characteristic parameters, and the structural characteristics of the SARS transmission networks are comprehensively and systematically explored.

Method Literature review through the Chinese CAJ full-text database. Results The number of Chinese publications on mathematical modelling has at least quadrupled since the SARS epidemic in 2003. This increase not only included papers on SARS, but also on various other infectious diseases, indicating a substantial expansion of modelling experience in China. Typical problems of most studies were poor availability of data and lack of involvement of disease experts and decision-makers rendering the studies less useful for policies on control. Conclusions We expect that the recent experience on modelling and current better access to and exchange of epidemiological data have paved the way for a more substantial role of this discipline during possible future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome: A global view of the epidemic,"Franco-Paredes, C.; Kuri-Morales, P.; Alvarez-Lucas, C.; Palacios-Zavala, E.; Nava-Frias, M.; Betancourt-Cravioto, M.; Santos-Preciado, J. I.; Tapia-Conyer, R.","In early February 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) began receiving reports of patients with a syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia with rapid progression to respiratory failure without an identified cause despite extensive diagnostic workups. Most of these reports pointed out that the outbreak started in Southern China, specifically in the Guandong Province. The initial outbreak in South East Asia has already spread to other Regions in Asia, Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. Many of these cases can be linked through chains of transmission to an index case from the Guandong Province who visited Hong Kong. Although the exact mode of transmission has not been clearly established, the etiology of this syndrome has already been identified. A novel Coronovirus has been identified by electron microscopy and molecular assays in multiple laboratories from respiratory specimens throughout the world. The syndrome has been defined as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) by WHO, and is characterized by an incubation period between I and 10 days (average 5 days) and by a febrile phase that usually lasts approximately 3 days. During the respiratory phase that begins around day 3, patients start developing a dry cough,shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilatory support is required in about 10 to 40% of cases and the case-fatality rate ranges between 3 and 16%. The laboratory findings in SARS cases include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a rise in transaminases and lactic dehydrogenase levels. Treatment of SARS includes supportive measures and the empiric use of ribavirin. Respiratory isolation, use of respiratory masks, and compulsory hand hygiene constitute the principal preventive measures. The confirmation of a case can be performed at reference laboratories by serologic and molecular assays. From the onset of this epidemic Mexico established a surveillance system as well as clinical guidelines and recommendations for the identification, prevention of secondary spread, and medical management of suspicious and probable cases by health care personnel.

The effects of community interactions and quarantine on a complex network,"Chimmalee, B.; Sawangtong, W.; Wiwatanapataphee, B.","An adaptive complex network based on a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) framework is implemented to investigate the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease. The topology and its relations with network parameters are discussed. Using the primary outbreak data from the SEIQR network model, a regression model is developed to describe the relation between the quarantine rate and the key epidemiological parameters. We approximate the quarantine rate as a function of the number of individuals visiting communities and hubs, then incorporate it into the adaptive complex network to investigate the disease transmission dynamics. The proposed quantity can be estimated from the outbreak data and hence is more approachable as compared to the constant rate. Our results suggest that contact radius, hub radius, number of hubs, hub capacity and transmission rate may be important determinants to predict the disease spread and severity of outbreaks. Moreover, our results also suggest that during an outbreak, closing down certain public facilities or reducing their capacities and reducing the number of individuals visiting communities or public places, may significantly slow down the disease spread.",2016,,Cogent Mathematics,3,1,,WOS:000422734900003,10.1080/23311835.2016.1249141,,#11673,Chimmalee 2016,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

Incorporating geographical contacts into Social Network Analysis for contact tracing in epidemiology: A study on Taiwan SARS data,"Chen, Y. D.; Tseng, C. J.; King, C. C.; Wu, T. S. J.; Chen, H. C.; Zeng, D.","In epidemiology, contact tracing is a process to control the spread of an infectious disease and identify individuals who were previously exposed to patients with the disease. After the emergence of AIDS, Social Network Analysis (SNA) was demonstrated to be a good supplementary tool for contact tracing. Traditionally, social networks for disease investigations are constructed only with personal contacts. However, for diseases which transmit not only through personal contacts, incorporating geographical contacts into SNA has been demonstrated to reveal potential contacts among patients. In this research, we use Taiwan SARS data to investigate the differences in connectivity between personal and geographical contacts in the construction of social networks for these diseases. According to our results, geographical contacts, which increase the average degree of nodes from 0 to 108.62 and decrease the number of components from 961 to 82, provide much higher connectivity than personal contacts. Therefore, including geographical contacts is important to understand the underlying context of the transmission of these diseases. We further explore the differences in network topology between one-mode networks with only patients and multi-mode networks with patients and geographical locations for disease investigation. We find that including geographical locations as nodes in a social network provides a good way to see the role that those locations play in the disease transmission and reveal potential bridges among those geographical locations and households.",2007,,,4506,,23-+,WOS:000246687800003,,,#11778,Chen 2007,Exclusion reason: No peer review; Janetta Skarp (2019-09-11 01:11:50)(Select): Book?; Mara Kont (2019-07-01 21:00:10)(Select): Go to p.23; ,

SARS: Epidemiology,"Chan-Yeung, M.; Xu, R. H.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Southern China in November 2002, and was brought to Hong Kong in February 2003. From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case fatality rate of 11%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at high risk and accounted for one-fifth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2-10). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptornatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment. Effective control of disease spread in the community included tracing and quarantine of contacts.

We mapped the SARS morbidity data with the spatial data resolution at the level of street and township. Two smoothing methods, Bayesian adjustment and spatial smoothing, were applied to identify the spatial risks and spatial transmission trends. Furthermore, we explored various spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolution of Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and LISA. Part of this study is targeted at evaluating the effectiveness of public health control measures implemented during the SARS epidemic. The main findings are as follows. (1) The diffusion speed of SARS in the northwest-southeast direction is weaker than that in northeast-southwest direction. (2) SARS's spread risk is positively spatially associated and the strength of this spatial association has experienced changes from weak to strong and then back to weak during the lifetime of the Beijing SARS epidemic. (3) Two spatial clusters of disease cases are identified: one in the city center and the other in the eastern suburban area. These two clusters followed different evolutionary paths but interacted with each other as well.

H.","In 2003, SARS was a serious health concern in Canada. As of September 3 of that year, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported a total of 438 cases: 251 Probable (247 Ontario, 4 British Columbia) and 187 Suspect (128 Ontario, 46 British Columbia). Although the outbreak was short-lived, more than forty people died from the disease. A substantial database evolved as a consequence of control efforts. Specimens began to be received and tested at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on March 17, 2003. NML's SARS database contains more than 12,000 records and 192 variables, with variables detailing clinical/diagnostic (17), microbiological (143), epidemiological (25), and administrative (7) features. Clinical variables include: diarrhea, difficulty of breathing, severity of illness, systemic status, date of onset of illness, case status, case status modification, and case status modification date. Diagnostic variables include: fever, chest X-ray change, cough, shortness of breath, contact with probable case, travel, source of exposure, and contact type. Epidemiological data include: date of birth, age, sex, epidemiology cluster, and employment status. Administrative data include: patient's last name, first name, temporal data (date of collection of the specimen, date of its receipt, and first date of hospitalization of the patient) and spatial data (origin of specimen, and identity of the hospital). A wide variety of laboratory tests are included in the database: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA, 7 variables), Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA, 7); plaque reduction neutralization test (PRN, 3); cytopathogenic test (CPE, 2), and electron microscopy test (EM, 8). There are tests for Coronavirus (13 variables), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 16), circovirus (Circo, 4), porcine circovirus (PCV1, 6), TT-virus (TTV, 7), TTV-like-mini-virus (TLMV, 7), Hantaanvirus (1), Rhinovirus (3), and Paramyxovirus (3). Nested PCR, RT-PCR, and sequencing tests are common among the viruses. The NML-SARS database evolved as part of an ongoing effort involving multiple institutions, multiple regions, intense time pressures, and the participation of many operational and scientific specialties (e. g., clinicians, epidemiologists, microbiologists, administrators). Although the database arose in response to a specific disease in Canada, it can be looked upon as an example of what might typically arise from a public-health response to an outbreak of an emerging disease. Hence there is value in analysing the NML-SARS database, looking for general characteristics, and highlighting where opportunities for scientific advances exist. This is our objective. Putative characteristics of outbreak-response data sets are: ad hoc by definition; evolving database and data administration; basic assumptions (e. g., case definition) open to refinement; and insights that are often merely suggestive. Opportunities for scientific advancement include: Exploratory Data Analysis of evolving data sets; definition of a relational data model appropriate to outbreak-response data sets; improvement of statistical data modelling methodology to estimate empty blocks of cells (resulting as emerging understanding directs interest from one area to another); data analysis to refine basic assumptions made during control operations; process modelling to explore consequences of unverified insights.",2009,,,,,136-142,WOS:000290045000017,,,#12219,Cuff 2009,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

Results The average duration of onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, of admission to discharge for those who survived was 29.7 days, while admission to death for casualties was 17.4 days. Health care workers, patients from Tianjin and patients infected towards the end of the epidemic had the shortest duration of onset to admission. Regarding admission to discharge, particularly young patients and patients from Guangdong had the shortest duration. Older age was the sole factor associated with shorter duration of admission to death. Conclusions The average duration and pattern (with time of epidemic and age) of onset of symptoms to hospital admission of SARS patients in mainland China were comparable to other affected areas.

Methods Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo-coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a 'case-control' design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel-related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. Results The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter-provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. Conclusions This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter-provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association.

Published data on sequelae of SARS are limited. Clinical follow-up of patients who recovered from SARS has demonstrated radiological, functional and psychological abnormalities of varying degrees. In the early rehabilitation phase, many complained of limitations in physical function from general weakness and/or shortness of breath. In a small series of subjects who underwent CT scan of the chest, over half showed some patchy changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Lung function testing at 6-8 weeks after hospital discharge showed mild or moderate restrictive pattern consistent with muscle weakness in 6-20% of subjects. Mild decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was detected in a minority of subjects. Preliminary evidence suggests that these lung function abnormalities will improve over time. Psychobehavioural problems of anxiety and/or depression were not uncommon in the early recovery phase, and improved over time in the majority of patients. Avascular necrosis of the hip has been reported as another complication. The long-term sequelae of SARS are still largely unknown.

"A Mini Review of the Zoonotic Threat Potential of Influenza Viruses, Coronaviruses, Adenoviruses, and Enteroviruses","Bailey, E. S.; Fieldhouse, J. K.; Choi, J. Y.; Gray, G. C.","During the last two decades, scientists have grown increasingly aware that viruses are emerging from the human-animal interface. In particular, respiratory infections are problematic; in early 2003, World Health Organization issued a worldwide alert for a previously unrecognized illness that was subsequently found to be caused by a novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus]. In addition to SARS, other respiratory pathogens have also emerged recently, contributing to the high burden of respiratory tract infection-related morbidity and mortality. Among the recently emerged respiratory pathogens are influenza viruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. As the genesis of these emerging viruses is not well understood and their detection normally occurs after they have crossed over and adapted to man, ideally, strategies for such novel virus detection should include intensive surveillance at the human-animal interface, particularly if one believes the paradigm that many novel emerging zoonotic viruses first circulate in animal populations and occasionally infect man before they fully adapt to man; early detection at the human-animal interface will provide earlier warning.

In 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for an unknown emerging illness, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in more than 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. Since then, we have witnessed the emergence of several other viral respiratory pathogens including influenza viruses (avian influenza H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8; variant influenza A H3N2 virus), human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In response, various surveillance systems have been developed to monitor the emergence of respiratory-tract infections. These include systems based on identification of syndromes, web-based systems, systems that gather health data from health facilities (such as emergency departments and family doctors), and systems that rely on self-reporting by patients.

"Global cities and the spread of infectious disease: The case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, Canada","Ali, S. H.; Keil, R.","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto and other cities in 2003 showed a heightened sensitivity of places in the global economy to rapid changes brought on by the acceleration of social and ecological relationships. The spread of the SARS virus may be a predictable consequence of these processes. The paper investigates how processes of globalisation have affected the transmission and response to SARS within the context of the global cities network. Little work has been done on the relationship of global city formation and the spread of infectious disease. Arguing that this relationship may be central to understanding the intricate capillary structures of the globalised network, the paper focuses on how pathogens interact with economic, political and social factors.

A Nonhomogeneous Agent-Based Simulation Approach to Modeling the Spread of Disease in a Pandemic Outbreak,"Aleman, D. M.; Wibisono, T. G.; Schwartz, B.","To effectively prepare for a pandemic disease outbreak, knowledge of how the disease will spread is paramount. The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 highlighted the need for such data. This need is also apparent in preparing for and responding to all disease outbreaks, from pandemic influenza to avian flu. Many previous studies of disease make simplistic assumptions about transmission and infection rates and assume that each member of the population is identical or homogeneous. We propose an agent-based simulation model that treats each individual as unique, with nonhomogeneous transmission and infection rates correlated to demographic information and behavior. The results of the model are output to geographic information system software to provide a map of the estimated disease spread area, which can be used as a policy-making tool for determining a suitable mitigation strategy.

Three-strategy and four-strategy model of vaccination game introducing an intermediate protecting measure,"Alam, M.; Kuga, K.; Tanimoto, J.","We build a new analytic scheme that competently reproduces the decision-making process of choosing an imperfect provision based on the evolutionary game theory dovetailed with the SIR model for epidemic spreading dynamics. Aside from considering the two extreme options whether or not taking vaccination, we consider an 'intermediate defense measure' (IDM) that emulates hand-washing, masking, gargling, and taking energy drinks, defined as the third strategy while taking vaccination as well as IDM at the same time as the fourth strategy. In the present study, each of the proposed three imperfect provisions is able to oppress infectious diseases like Flu, Influenza, Ebola, and SARS during an epidemic season with certain extent. Considering an infinite and well-mixed population, a new analytic framework is built to take care of those three cases instead of perfect vaccination. Unlike MAS (multi-agent simulation) approach we conduct our study throughout using the so-called theoretical approach. Besides that, three different strategy updating rules based on evolutionary game theory have also been considered in our proposed model. We successfully obtain phase diagrams showing the final epidemic size, social average payoff and the respective fractions of the different strategy holders using various values of effectiveness and efficiency coefficients. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is made with comparison among the two-, three- and four-strategy models to get a holistic idea justifying how imperfect provisions work during an epidemic spreading.

Review of research studies on population specific epidemic disasters,"Adivar, B.; Selen, E. S.","Purpose - This study aims to analyze the epidemic modeling applications and policy-making strategies for six different infectious diseases in a number of countries, thus comparing and contrasting research in underdeveloped, developing, and developed countries. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review has been conducted by identifying relevant studies for six diseases from different sources and selecting 74 publications for inclusion. These selected publications are classified and analyzed based on infectious disease, control policies, theme and objective, methodology, origin of population data, publication year and results. Findings - Review results indicate that disaster preparedness and surveillance plans for epidemics are available mostly for developed countries. There is a need for further research in both developing and developed countries because of the ease of dispersion, which constitutes a universal threat. Analysis of the publications suggests that epidemic disasters are mostly studied by researchers in the field of medicine or biology with the aim of assessing the potential impact of an epidemic. The authors highlight the need for further research in operations research and disaster management fields and propose further research directions in the area of disaster management. Social implications - This review emphasizes the importance of epidemic disaster modeling for the preparedness stage of disaster management and policy making. Disease and population-specific intervention policies (e.g. vaccination) reported in this review should set an example and help policy makers during their decision making.

RVIs constitute the most frequent reason for medical consultations in the world and they have a considerable impact on quality of life and productivity. Therefore, the prevention and control of RVIs remain major clinical goals. Currently, there are approximately 200 known respiratory viruses that can be grouped into one family of DNA viruses (Adenoviridae) and four families of RNA viruses (Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picomaviridae and Coronaviridae).

Occupational Exposure and Respiratory Tract Infections - At Risk Workers in the International Context,"Aasen, T. B.","Infectious diseases transmitted at work are frequent globally. Lung infections due to exposure at work are mainly affecting two broad groups, health care workers (HCW) and people exposed occasionally to sick animals. The main challenge globally during the last decades has been tuberculosis (TB), different influenza strains and coronaviruses. TB is still a global threat infecting almost 9 mill people world-wide and causing 1, 4 mill deaths (2011). Influenza is common during winters in smaller epidemics, but has also caused serious pandemics (1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009). TB in miners is a major health problem in South-Africa. Avian influenza is caused by the influenza A strain in birds. Humans may acquire avian influenza by inhalations of droplets or by contact from infected material. Different avian strains have been shown to infect humans (H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2 strains). Swine influenza H1N1 (S-OIV) were reported from Mexico in 2009 with a further rapid spread to other countries and causing a pandemic. The syndrome of SARS caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was first described in Guangdong, China in 2002. The infection spread rapidly and 29 countries were affected in the first epidemic in 2002-3. In 2012 a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) related to SARS was described in a Saudi Arabian patient who died of pneumonia and multi-organ failure (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - MERS). Other occupational respiratory infections are also encountered, among them legionella, psittacosis and Q-fever. Increased mortality of pneumonia in welders is a special problem, probably due to reduced resistance to infection because of welding fumes.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings and response to four treatment protocols in 190 SARS patients are presented. Methods: We analysed case notes, laboratory findings and prospectively collected outcome measures in a cohort of 190 patients randomly allocated to four treatment regimens (A-D). Results: Patients were infected by close contact either in family or healthcare settings, particularly following procedures likely to generate aerosols of respiratory secretions. The earliest symptom was pyrexia followed by dyspnoea, cough, myalgia with 24% of patients complaining of diarrhoea. The commonest chest x-ray changes were patchy consolidation progressing to bilateral bronchopneumonia over 5-10, 36 cases developed ARDS, 11 died. All groups received antibiotics but there was no response. All patients with a SaO2 ltoreq92% were ventilated via a nasal mask and intubated if not improved.

METHODS: Eighty-one hemodialysis units were investigated on the incidence and preventive measures for SARS from March to July 2003 by a standardized investigation form. RESULTS: (1) Seven hemodialysis patients were diagnosed as SARS clinically and account for 0.24% of total 2885 hemodialysis patients in these units in Beijing. Among the 7 SARS patients, 3 recovered from SARS and 4 died. No case was infected within the hemodialysis units. No SARS case or suspected case was found in the health care workers in hemodialysis units. (2) Additional disinfected measures were carried out in all the hemodialysis units. 98.8% (80/81) of them did not reuse the dialyzer. (3) 98.8% (80/81) of the hemodialysis units developed education about preventing SARS among hemodialysis patients. Before dialysis treatment patients must take temperature, change specific clothes and shoes in over 90% of the hemodialysis units. (4) All health care workers in the hemodialysis units wore hats and gauze masks and 93.7% (74/79) of them wore gloves. Eye shield was worn in 22.8% (18/79) of the dialysis units centers.

Molecular evolution of group 2 coronaviruses,"Vijgen, Leen; Keyaerts, Els; Van Ranst, Marc; Thiel, V.","Coronaviruses are well-equipped to adapt rapidly to changing ecological niches based on two major forces that drive their viral evolution: mutation and recombination. Based on the available nucleotide and amino acid sequence information, the evolutionary relationships among coronaviruses can be inferred by using molecular phylogenetic approaches. The calculation of an evolutionary rate provides an indication of the rate at which mutations become fixed in the coronavirus population. The divergence of ancestral strains of existing coronaviruses with a different host-specificity can be dated back in history, thereby estimating the time in which potential interspecies transmission events occurred. A similar cross-species jumping led to the emergence of the SARS coronavirus, that has been proposed to be an early split-off from group 2 coronaviruses. Within group 2 a subdivision into murine hepatitis virus-related and bovine coronavirus-related coronaviruses has been suggested. The remarkably high genetic similarity among the bovine coronavirus-related coronaviruses indicates a relatively recent common evolutionary history. In this chapter, we discuss the molecular evolution of these closely related group 2 coronaviruses.",2007,,,,,143-157,BCI:BCI200800113212,,,#14987,Vijgen 2007,Exclusion reason: No peer review; Isobel Routledge (2019-07-09 20:40:23)(Select): book chapter: https://www.caister.com/hsp/abstracts/cor/07.html; ,Phylogenetic studies
Human coronaroviruses,"Vabret, A.; Mourez, T.; Dina, J.; Freyrnuth, F.","Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses and infect a lot of species of mammals and birds. Five coronaviruses currently infect humans : HCoVs 229E and OC43, identified in 1960's, SARS-CoV identified in March 2003 during the SARS epidemic, and the HCoVs NL63 and HKU1, identified in 2004 and 2005. The genome of the coronaviruses is a linear, nonsegmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 30 kb. The evolution of these viruses occurs through some features : the flexibility of the genome including a high number of potentially non-essential genes, the demonstrated ability of the coronaviruses to establish persistent infections, the quasi-species structure of the viral population, the ability to undergo RNA mutations, deletions and recombinations at a high frequency. Two epidemiologic pictures of human coronavirus infections have to be distinguished : as suggested by a few epidemiologic studies, the classical coronaviruses, including HCoVs 229E, OC43, and NL63 are distributed worldwide and would circulate during seasonal outbreaks. In contrast, the SARS-CoV is responsible of the first new emerging infectious disease of this millennium, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800 during a period of six months beginning at the end of 2002. Human coronaviruses may be also involved in enteric and neurologic diseases. The detection of coronaviruses is difficult and mainly based on molecular assays (RT-PCR).

T.","Background: SARS is an emerging nosocomial infection. By 17 March, with 21 cases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore (TTSH) was made the national ""SARS hospital"" to contain the virus. Methods: At the 900 bed National University Hospital (NUH), all patients are triaged at entry and those with undifferentiated fever or respiratory symptoms are isolated with full respiratory and contact precautions in single mostly negative pressure rooms. All cases meeting WHO criteria for suspect (SSARS) or probable SARS (PSARS) are transferred to TTSH. All NUH staff now use N95 masks, gloves, gowns and goggles for all patient contact and report their temperature thrice daily. Visitors are now generally barred from the hospital. Powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) are used for aerosol inducing procedures. Results: 18 cases of PSARS have been treated at NUH, 6/9 tested had positive PCRs for SARS coronavirus in stool, blood or respiratory samples. In addition 2 visitors were infected in NUH. 11 nosocomial cases of SARS were identified by active surveillance. All resulted from two undiagnosed patients who spent 5-12 hours in general areas before isolation. Two were physicians wearing gloves, gowns, masks and glasses while performing ICU procedures before introduction of PAPR, three were nurses before full universal precautions, the rest were either visitors (2) or other patients (4). Monitoring of 3233 staff led to 126 evaluations and detection of 5 PSARS cases. 607 isolated patients have yielded 29 SSARS and 10 PSARS cases, an overall ""rule-out ratio"" of 61:1. Now, 6,790 N95 masks and 39,850 gloves are used every day. There have been no intra-hospital transmissions of SARS for the last fourteen days since the introduction of these costly measures. Conclusions: Full universal precautions can protect staff but Administrative Controls to detect atypical cases are critical to protect visitors and other patients.

Methods: Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect the SARS coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in serum specimens, including 1453 healthy persons from Hongkong, Marco, Guangzhou and Peking and 257 SARS probable patients from Guangzhou and Peking. The dynamics of the serum antibodies of SARS patients were observed from 3 to 270 days after onset of symptoms.

These two specimens were negative by IFA. 90% of 257 patient serum specimens after 20 days of disease onset showed positive SARS-CoV IgG either using ELISA or IFA. Of 257 SARS patients, antibodies titers increased steadily in early 4 to 6 months after onset of SARS. The titers of most cases came to the peak in the 61 month, and maintained the titers for two months. Then antibodies titers declined in some cases.

Methods: The data of SARS warning and ILI monitoring in Wuxi City from 2005-2010 were analyzed. EWMA method was used to set the upper limit which was evaluated for its value on influenza outbreak early warning. Results: The surveillance data of ILI and SARS (acute respiratory illness, ARI) showed there were 3 obvious peaks in 11-14 week in 2006, 33-36 week and 46-48 week in 2009, and the 2 moving average lines were basically the same. Pathogen monitoring indicated the peak of influenza virus isolation positive rate coincided with ILI and ARI peaks, and the epidemic status in 2006 was type B dominant in outbreak with type A (H1N1) of sporadic cases. The phenomenon of 4 kinds of strains simultaneously detected in August and September 2009 had been gradually replaced by the new emerging of H1N1. EWMA warning results showed ILI and ARI both alerted at week 47 in 2005, at week 11-13 in 2006, at week 11, 33-34, at week 36 and 46 in 2009. The warning signals were basically consistent with the actual influenza outbreaks in Wuxi City in 2006 and 2009.

Totally, 2 521 portable cases were diagnosed and verified according to the diagnostic criteria of SARS issued by the Ministry of Health. Among them, 192 died from SARS. The incidence and mortality rates of SARS were 18.57 per 100,000 and 1.41 per 100,000 with the fatality of 7.6%. The ratio of male to female with SARS was 1:0.97. The highest incidence rate of SARS was in the group of 20 - 29 years (30.85 per 100,000), and the lowest was in the group of 0 - 14 years (2.54 per 100,000). People aged 20 - 49 accounted for 72.3% of all SARS cases. The incidence rates in urban, suburb and far-suburb were 32.25/100,000, 20.57/100,000 and 8.90/100,000, respectively, decreasing according to the population density. Health care providers (17.3%), staff (12.9%), retirees (11.4%), workers (9.7%) and house-hold unemployees (8.8%) appeared to be at the five top risk populations being infected.

Herein, we screened 12,000 people in a community stricken by SARS 10 months previously and found 53 individuals (0.44%) who had immunoglobulin G antibodies to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) produced in bacteria. However, only seven of these (group 1) had sera which also reacted with the native N antigen expressed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, N-transfected 293T cells, and tissues of infected SARS patients. Of these, six individuals had had SARS previously. The remaining person, as well as the 46 other individuals (group 2), were healthy and had no history of SARS. Group 1 antibodies recognized epitopes located slightly differently in N from those of group 2 antibodies, and a mouse hybridoma antibody resembling the former type was generated. Unusually, group 2 antibodies appeared to recognize crossreactive bacterial epitopes that presumably were posttranslationally modified in eukaryotes and hence were probably not induced by SARS-CoV or related coronaviruses but rather by bacteria.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Kanra, Guler; Kara, Ates","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has recently been recognized as a newly emerging infectious disease that is highly contagious with significant morbidity and mortality. Earliest cases of SARS has been described in patients in Asia, North America, and Europe. Etiological agent of SARS is shown to be a coronavirus. Most coronaviruses cause disease in only one host species. All known coronaviruses are found in three serologically unrelated groups. A corona of large, distinctive spikes in the envelope makes possible the identification of coronaviruses by electron microscopy. In this way the first identification of agent was possible. Microbiologic and genetic analyses have shown that the SARS-associated coronavirus is neither a mutant nor a recombinant of any known coronaviruses. It is a previously unknown coronavirus, probably from a nonhuman host, that somehow acquired the ability to infect humans. Serologic tests of wild and domestic animals and birds in the region where the outbreak first appeared may identify the usual host. The incubation period for SARS is typically 2-7 days; however, isolated reports have suggested an incubation period as long as 10 days. The illness begins generally with a prodrome of fever (>38.0degreeC). Fever often is high, is sometimes associated with chills and rigors, and might be accompanied by other symptoms, including headache, malaise, and myalgia. At the onset of illness, some persons have mild respiratory symptoms. Typically, rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absent; however, some patients have reported diarrhea during the febrile prodrome. After 3-7 days, a lower respiratory phase begins with the onset of a dry, nonproductive cough or dyspnea, which might be accompanied by or progress to hypoxemia. In 10%-20% of cases, the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The case-fatality rate among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition of SARS is approximately 3%. Chest radiographs might be normal during the febrile prodrome and throughout the course of illness. However, in a substantial proportion of patients, the respiratory phase is characterized by early focal interstitial infiltrates progressing to more generalized, patchy, interstitial infiltrates. Some chest radiographs from patients in the late stages of SARS have also shown areas of consolidation. Early in the course of disease, the absolute lymphocyte count is often decreased. Overall white blood cell counts have generally been normal or decreased. At the peak of the respiratory illness, approximately 50% of patients have leukopenia and thrombocytopenia or low-normal platelet counts (50,000-150,000/muL). Early in the respiratory phase, elevated creatine phosphokinase levels (as high as 3,000 IU/L) and hepatic transaminases (2-6 times the upper limits of normal) have been noted. Treatment regimens have included several antibiotics to presumptively treat known bacterial agents of atypical pneumonia. In several locations, therapy has also included antiviral agents such as oseltamivir or ribavirin. Steroids have also been administered orally or intravenously to patients in combination with ribavirin and other antimicrobials. Although there are no approved drugs with proven efficacy against coronaviruses, there are potential targets for the development of new drugs. Protease inhibitors could prevent processing of the RNA polymerase or cleavage of the viral S glycoprotein. Inhibitors of coronavirus acetylesterase activity might limit viral replication.",2003,July-September,Cocuk Sagligi ve Hastaliklari Dergisi,46,3,155-161,BCI:BCI200400135662,,,#20055,Kanra 2003,Exclusion reason: Non-english; ,Diagnostics; Treatment
Methods to analyze SARS transmission,"Koopman, J. S.","Background: The modes of SARS transmission, the roles that different modes play in the circulation of the SARS coronavirus, and where control of different modes will do the most to slow epidemics must be known to efficiently guide control efforts. An analysis of the transmission system, not just of risk factors or of excretion and contamination modes, is needed. Standard study designs and analytic methods are not up to this task. Methods: Models were constructed where transmission occurs in ""venues"" consisting of sites or classes of social settings. Given identical early epidemic phases, the ultimate epidemic size and its response to control in different venues were shown to vary as a function of who goes to the venues. The models were used to generate data from an epidemic and new analytic methods using an MCMC approach were developed to analyze the data. Results: Identical early epidemics varied dramatically in ultimate size as a function of patterns of contact in different venues. The venues where control did the most to contain epidemics were not always those with the largest number of transmissions. Standard risk factor analysis methods, such as logistic regression, did a poor job of prioritizing venues for control. The MCMC analysis of transmission system data performed better. The utility of using physical characteristics of venues to set priors on transmission parameters in the analysis was demonstrated. Conclusions: If initial containment of SARS by strict and universal quarantine actions is lost, population based studies of transmission venues should be conducted and their results analyzed using methods based on transmission system models rather than standard risk factor assessment models. These studies should document the person-time in different venues of different classes of individuals, the physical characteristics of venues related to transmission, environmental cultures at venues, and the infection experience of each class of individuals. Site based surveys and routine surveillance data could be adequate. Various paths exist to further improving this analytic approach.",2003,2003,Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,43,,378-378,BCI:BCI200400025946,,,#20113,Koopman 2003,Exclusion reason: No peer review; Mara Kont (2019-07-02 02:06:53)(Select): Conference abstract; ,

SARS: A novel emergency for the world health,"Calza, Leonardo; Manfredi, Roberto; Verucchi, Gabriella; Chiodo, Francesco","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new life-threatening respiratory disease which has its origins in Guangdong province, China, where the earliest known cases were identified in November 2002. Since then, probable cases of SARS have been reported in 30 countries and the current cumulative number of cases is 8,240, with 745 deaths and a global fatality rate of 9%. The most frequently involved areas include China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Vietnam and Philippines. Most cases of SARS to date have occurred in young adults and this disease appears to spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact, involving exposure to infectious droplets and body fluids. This transmission pattern generally involves household members, health care workers and international travellers, while a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases in an housing estate of Hong Kong has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, malaise, non-productive cough and dyspnea, associated with pulmonary interstitial infiltrates on chest radiography. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the laboratory evidences indicate that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS, but the role of other concurrent viral agents (such as metapneumovirus) identified in these patients requires further investigation.",2003,Luglio-Agosto,Recenti Prog Med,94,07-Aug,283-294,BCI:BCI200300487839,,,#22879,Calza 2003,Exclusion reason: Non-english; Anne Cori (2019-06-27 18:01:33)(Select): couldn't find FT but this suggest the FT is in Italian: https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/12868233 ; ,

Results We obtained MLE, the approximate standard error of each parameter of GLM, and the results of significant test of GLM. The results from factorial analysis of SARS incubation period showed that both contact pattern and epidemic area had significant impacts on the incubation period; older patients had a longer incubation period; and the incubation period of the medical personnel was obviously shorter than that of the non-medical personnel.

The majority of children with suspected SARS were admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. We describe the clinical, laboratory and epidemiologic features of this cohort. Methods: Children were classified as having possible or probable SARS based on criteria modified from the WHO case definition. A predetermined clinical investigational protocol was established. A complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, AST, ALT, CPK, LDH and chest xray (CXR) were routinely performed. Microbiological tests included a nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirate for direct detection/culture of common respiratory viruses and PCR for coronavirus, a throat swab for S. pyogenes and M. pneumoniae, stool for electron microscopy and 2 blood cultures. Acute and convalescent sera were taken for analysis. Results: To date there have been 8 children with probable and 16 children with possible SARS (58% female); median age 2 years (range 14 days to 17.5 years). Ten children had a confirmed household exposure to 1 or more probable SARS cases; 7 had symptoms within 10 days of returning from a WHO reported ""affected area"" in south-east Asia and 7 had visited a Toronto hospital in which secondary SARS spread had occurred. The median Tmax was 39.2C (range 37.0C to 40.5C). Only 1 child required O2 supplementation. CXR abnormalities (probable cases) included airspace disease (4), perihilar infiltrates (2) and peribronchial thickening (2). Coronavirus PCR on NP aspirate samples was negative in all cases.

It is important that follow-ups be carried out to assess the clinical significance and persistence of such abnormalities. Oseltamivir has been widely used to treat viral diseases in clinical settings. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcomes of patients with SARS and to describe the effects of oseltamivir on SARS, along with variables associated with outcomes. Study design: This study evaluated 67 survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome treated with or without oseltamivir for 12 years after discharge from the hospital. At each visit, patients underwent physical examinations, pulmonary-function testing, echocardiographic examinations, and quality-of-life evaluations. Results: All survivors were asymptomatic and had normal clinical examinations. Mild pulmonary abnormalities were detected by lung function tests in 7 (10.45%) subjects, including residual ground-glass opacification or fibrosis (n=6) and air trapping (n=1). The need for mechanical ventilation (P=0.02) during the illness was a significant risk factor in predicting pneumonic fibrosis. There were no significant cardio-pulmonary function differences between those survivors treated with or without oseltamivir. Median scores for the physical role domain of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey decreased more than scores in the normal population, along with no significant differences between the two groups.

Super-spreaders: a historical review,"Teicher, A","The term super-spreader is used for multiple, and sometimes even conflicting, purposes. The reasons for this can be traced back to its complex history. Forerunners of the super-spreader concept-in discussions of so-called dangerous carriers and in analyses of explosive outbreaks during the early 20th century-revolved primarily around gastrointestinal diseases, not respiratory ones. In 1957-58, the H2N2 influenza pandemic and Wells and Riley's studies on tuberculosis drew attention to both the viability of airborne transmission and the existence of significant heterogeneity in infectivity. The term super-spreader was coined in 1972, in relation to computer simulations of influenza epidemics. Initially, super-spreaders were simply an additional feature within stochastic models of epidemics, with little effect on an epidemic's eventual course. The term was later appropriated to explain why outbreaks of airborne diseases continued in vaccinated populations, defying the predictions of contact-transmission-based models. The content and meaning of the term continued to fluctuate, from the mathematical characterisation of sexually active people with gonorrhoea, through HIV carriers with highly infectious semen, to central nodes within a network. This Historical Review reconstructs the historical growth of the concept of super-spreading, and offers insight into its current, highly diversified use.",2023,,LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES,23,10,E409-E417,WOS:001086010000001,10.1016/S1473-3099(23)00183-4,,#24544,Teicher 2023,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review
The Hybrid Incidence Susceptible-Transmissible-Removed Model for Pandemics Scaling Time to Predict an Epidemic's Population Density Dependent Temporal Propagation,"Benjamin, RL","The susceptible-transmissible-removed (STR) model is a deterministic compartment model, based on the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) prototype. The STR replaces 2 SIR assumptions. SIR assumes that the emigration rate (due to death or recovery) is directly proportional to the infected compartment's size. The STR replaces this assumption with the biologically appropriate assumption that the emigration rate is the same as the immigration rate one infected period ago. This results in a unique delay differential equation epidemic model with the delay equal to the infected period. Hamer's mass action law for epidemiology is modified to resemble its chemistry precursor-the law of mass action. Constructing the model for an isolated population that exists on a surface bounded by the extent of the population's movements permits compartment density to replace compartment size. The STR reduces to a SIR model in a timescale that negates the delay-the transmissible timescale. This establishes that the SIR model applies to an isolated population in the disease's transmissible timescale. Cyclical social interactions will define a rhythmic timescale. It is demonstrated that the geometric mean maps transmissible timescale properties to their rhythmic timescale equivalents. This mapping defines the hybrid incidence (HI). The model validation demonstrates that the HI-STR can be constructed directly from the disease's transmission dynamics. The basic reproduction number (R-0) is an epidemic impact property. The HI-STR model predicts that R-0 proportional to B root rho(n) where rho(n) is the population density, and B is the ratio of time increments in the transmissible- and rhythmic timescales. The model is validated by experimentally verifying the relationship. R-0's dependence on rho(n) is demonstrated for droplet-spread SARS in Asian cities, aerosol-spread measles in Europe and non-airborne Ebola in Africa.",2022,,ACTA BIOTHEORETICA,70,1,,WOS:000748316200001,10.1007/s10441-021-09431-1,,#24594,Benjamin 2022,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,transmission model
Protective population behavior change in outbreaks of emerging infectious disease,"Lodge, EK; Schatz, AM; Drake, JM","BackgroundDuring outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infections, the lack of effective drugs and vaccines increases reliance on non-pharmacologic public health interventions and behavior change to limit human-to-human transmission. Interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission.MethodsThis investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks.ResultsWe found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.ConclusionsThese findings highlight intrinsic population-level changes in isolation rates in multiple epidemics of three zoonotic infections with established human-to-human transmission and significant morbidity and mortality.

Neurocognitive Outcome Following Recovery from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1),"Pinnock, FS; Rich, JB; Vasquez, B; Wiegand, M; Patcai, J; Troyer, AK; Murphy, KJ","Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious viral respiratory illness associated with hypoxia and dyspnea. Many of those who contracted and recovered from SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak reported persistent physical, psychological, and cognitive difficulties. Here, we investigated the residual influences of SARS on cognition for a subset of healthcare professionals who recovered and were referred for neuropsychological evaluation through their workplace insurance. Method: Twenty-eight healthcare professionals were evaluated on neuropsychological and mood functioning approximately 1.5 years post-recovery from a severe respiratory illness. Test scores were compared with age-matched normative data, and correlations were examined between mood, self-report memory scales, subjective complaints (e.g., poor concentration, pain, fatigue), illness severity (i.e., length of hospitalization, oxygen use during hospital stay), and cognitive performance. Results: Participants performed within age expectations on the majority of cognitive measures including overall memory ability. Although processing speed was generally within normal limits, 43% showed significant speed-accuracy trade-offs favoring accuracy over maintaining speed. Deficits were observed on measures of complex attention, such as working memory and the ability to sustain attention under conditions of distraction. Participants endorsed poorer memory ability than same-age peers on a meta-memory measure and mild to moderate depression and anxiety symptoms. Objective test performance was largely uncorrelated with self-reports, mood, or illness severity, except for moderate correlations between complex attention and participants' subjective ratings of Everyday Task-Oriented Memory. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate specific long-term cognitive deficits associated with SARS and provide further evidence of the cognitive effects of hypoxic illnesses.",2022,,JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,28,9,891-901,WOS:000768641400001,10.1017/S1355617721001107,,#24643,Pinnock 2022,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in pregnancy - An overview,"Babarinsa, IA; Okunoye, GO; Odukoya, O","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, like most other viruses that affect the respiratory tract can cause severe maternal illness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. They are not only highly transmissible (acquired through droplets), but Host reservoirs such as dromedary camels for MERS-CoV and masked palm civet for SARS-CoV-1 are critical links in the onset of outbreaks. Clinically they present with flu-like symptoms and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and tailored management. Although there are not many reported series on these infections in pregnancy they seem to be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Diagnosis is made by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. There are currently no effective anti-viral agents for these viruses but following infections various agents have been administered to patients. The most important aspect of management should be early identification of deterioration and intensive support and prevention of transmission. Our understanding of the evidence of the impact of both infections on pregnancies suggests the potential for future repeat outbreaks, hence the importance of maintaining vigilance across healthcare systems.

Evaluating the potential impact of targeted vaccination strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks in the healthcare setting,"Abdirizak, F; Lewis, R; Chowell, G","Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are two coronaviruses with demonstrated potential to generate significant nosocomial outbreaks. In particular, MERS continues to pose a significant threat in the Middle East since 2012. Currently, no licensed vaccine or drug treatment is available to treat patients infected with either coronavirus. However, there are some MERS vaccines in the preclinical stage of development. We sought to evaluate the potential impact of targeted vaccination strategies for mitigating SARS and MERS outbreaks in healthcare settings using simple mathematical models and detailed historic transmission trees describing the progression of past nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and MERS. Results Our findings suggest that vaccination strategies targeting patients and healthcare workers, which have been disproportionately affected during past outbreaks, and assuming two vaccination coverage levels at 50 and 75% have the potential to avert nearly 50% or more of MERS or SARS cases.

Long-term effect of childhood pandemic experience on medical major choice: Evidence from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in China,"Chen, Z; Wang, Y; Guan, YJ; Guo, MJ; Xu, R","This study examines the long-term effect of a pandemic on a crucial human capital decision, namely college major choice. Using China's 2008-2016 major-level National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao) entry grades, we find that the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a substantial deterrent effect on the choice of majoring in medicine among high school graduates who experienced the pandemic in their childhood. In provinces with larger intensities of SARS impact, medical majors become less popular as the average Gaokao grades of enrolled students decline. Further evidence from a nationally representative survey shows that the intensity of the SARS impact significantly decreases children's aspirations to pursue medical occupations, but does not affect their parents' expectations for their children to enter the medical profession. Our discussion on the effect mechanism suggests that the adverse influence of SARS on the popularity of medical majors likely originates from students' childhood experiences.",2023,,HEALTH ECONOMICS,32,5,1120-1147,WOS:000935775400001,10.1002/hec.4659,,#24686,Chen 2023,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

This study is a retrospective cohort study. Data have been collected from the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education between 17 February 2016 and17 February 2018. The Neural Network Model has been used to predict SARS infection. Based on the results of the multivariate Poisson regression and the analysis of the coexistence of the variables, the minimum daily temperature was positively associated with the risk of SARS in men and women. The risk of SARS has increased in women and men with increasing daily rainfall. According to the result, by changes in bioclimatic parameters, the number of SARS patients will be increased in cities of Iran. Our study has shown a significant relationship between SARS and the climatic variables by the type of climate and gender. The estimates suggest that hospital admissions for climate-related respiratory diseases in Iran will increase by 36% from 2020 to 2050.

"Molecular epidemiology, evolution and phylogeny of SARS coronavirus","Luk, HKH; Li, X; Fung, J; Lau, SKP; Woo, PCY","Shortly after its emergence in southern China in 2002/2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was confirmed to be the cause of SARS. Subsequently, SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) were found in palm civets from live animal markets in Guangdong and in various horseshoe bat species, which were believed to be the ultimate reservoir of SARSr-CoV. Till November 2018, 339 SARSr-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 274 from human, 18 from civets and 47 from bats [mostly from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), n = 30; and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), n = 9]. The human SARS-CoVs and civet SARSr-CoVs were collected in 2003/2004, while bat SARSr-CoVs were continuously isolated in the past 13 years even after the cessation of the SARS epidemic. SARSr-CoVs belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (previously lineage B) of genus Betacoronavirus and occupy a unique phylogenetic position. Overall, it is observed that the SARSr-CoV genomes from bats in Yunnan province of China possess the highest nucleotide identity to those from civets. It is evident from both multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses that some genes of a particular SARSr-CoV from bats may possess higher while other genes possess much lower nucleotide identity to the corresponding genes of SARSr-CoV from human/civets, resulting in the shift of phylogenetic position in different phylogenetic trees. Our current model on the origin of SARS is that the human SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic in 2002/2003 was probably a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARSr-CoV ancestors in different horseshoe bat species.",2019,,INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION,71,,21-30,WOS:000465457800004,10.1016/j.meegid.2019.03.001,,#24719,Luk 2019,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review

Chronic PTSD and Other Psychological Sequelae in a Group of Frontline Healthcare Workers Who Contracted and Survived SARS,"Moallef, P; Lueke, NA; Gardner, PJ; Patcai, J","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 was highly concentrated in health care settings and resulted in a high number of health care workers (HCWs) contracting the disease. The SARS epidemic has improved our understanding of how trauma impacts frontline HCWs who serve as first responders during an infectious disease outbreak. However, our insight into the trajectory of frontline HCWs' morbidity posttrauma continues to be limited, as the majority of the previous work has focused on the short-term or immediate impact of SARS on HCWs, with only a few studies dedicated to the evaluation of its long-term or sustained impact. Previous research into the long-term impact of SARS on HCWs spans 1-3 years postoutbreak. The present study extends previous research by examining HCWs up to 7 years postoutbreak. More specifically, frontline HCWs who contracted and survived SARS were evaluated at 1 year (2004), 4 years (2007), and 7 years (2010) postoutbreak by using a within-participants design. Across all three time points, frontline HCWs showed a lack of abatement in clinically significant levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. In addition, HCWs reported below average and persistent functional outcomes, such as problems with pain, reduced vitality, and reductions in physical, mental, and social functioning. Finally, we report on the particular psychiatric variables from 1 year postoutbreak that are significantly associated with functional debility at 4 and 7 years postoutbreak. Findings of this study underscore the importance of understanding the long-term sequelae of infectious disease outbreaks on frontline HCWs, in order to decrease the likelihood of chronic adverse outcomes in this population.

In the first two decades of the 21st century, we have born witness to the emergence of newly recognized coronaviruses that have rapidly spread around the globe, including severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS). We have also experienced the emergence of a novel H1N1 pandemic influenza strain in 2009 that caused substantial morbidity and mortality around the world and has transitioned into a seasonal strain. Although we perhaps most frequently think of viruses when discussing emerging respiratory infections, bacteria have not been left out of the mix, as we have witnessed an increase in the number of infections from Legionella spp. since the organisms' initial discovery in 1976. Here, we explore the basic epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, and clinical laboratory diagnosis of these four pathogens and emphasize themes in humans' evolving relationship with our natural environment that have contributed to the infectious burden. Histology alone is rarely diagnostic for these infections, but has been crucial to bettering our understanding of these diseases. Together, we rely on the diagnostic acumen of pathologists to identify the clinicopathologic features that raise the suspicion of these diseases and lead to the early control of the spread in our populations.",2019,,SEMINARS IN DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY,36,3,152-159,WOS:000472127900003,10.1053/j.semdp.2019.04.006,,#24836,Bradley 2019,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,

Maximum Likelihood Method on The Construction of Phylogenetic Tree for Identification the Spreading of SARS Epidemic,"Amiroch, S; Pradana, MS; Irawan, MI; Mukhlash, I",There are several phylogenetic tree construction methods that can be used to illustrate the spread of disease epidemics. One of the methods used is probability-based maximum likelihood. This paper explains how to identify the spread of the SARS epidemic in the world using the formation of phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood method. The output obtained was a description of the spread of SARS virus with the selection of tree candidates after performing a heuristic search of the Stepwise Addition method.

A novel sub-epidemic modeling framework for short-term forecasting epidemic waves,"Chowell, G; Tariq, A; Hyman, JM","BackgroundSimple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories.MethodsWe develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics.ResultsThe sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics.ConclusionsOur findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.",2019,,BMC MEDICINE,17,1,,WOS:000483379400001,10.1186/s12916-019-1406-6,,#24895,Chowell 2019,"Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Thomas Rawson (2024-02-23 01:15:40)(Included): A model of multiple logistic growth curves to fit to SARS data, but note that it's not actually a model of transmission therefore.; ",
Will infectious disease outbreaks cause a decline in investment of real sector firms? Evidence form 2003 SARS outbreak in China,"Zhang, Z; Ma, CY; Hu, H; Li, H","The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak prompts researchers and policy makers to re-evaluate the impact of infectious disease on economy. Taking SARS outbreak in 2003 as a quasi-natural experiment, we examined the impact of infectious diseases on Chinese real sector's investment through a difference in difference (DID) approach. The empirical results show that after the outbreak of SARS, the investment of China's real sector firms had increased significantly. This conclusion is verified by several robustness tests. The mechanism tests indicate that the SARS epidemic could increase the investment of real sector firms through two paths. First of all, the outbreak of the epidemic led to dramatic fluctuations in the capital market, then companies shifted their assets from the financial market to the relatively low-risk real sector; additionally, in response to the outbreak of SARS, companies and the government reduced operating costs and fees, resulting in a synergistic effect which also increased investment of the real sector.",2021,,APPLIED ECONOMICS,53,59,6820-6838,WOS:000695506900001,10.1080/00036846.2021.1949431,,#24909,Zhang 2021,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are lower than other coronaviruses suggesting a faster protein synthesis rate of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV,"Yang, CW; Chen, MF","Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs. Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains.Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.

Ruiz-Aravena, McKee and colleagues analyse the currently available information on bat coronaviruses and discuss their role in recent and potential future spillovers.In the past two decades, three coronaviruses with ancestral origins in bats have emerged and caused widespread outbreaks in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, the appreciation of bats as key hosts of zoonotic coronaviruses has advanced rapidly. More than 4,000 coronavirus sequences from 14 bat families have been identified, yet the true diversity of bat coronaviruses is probably much greater. Given that bats are the likely evolutionary source for several human coronaviruses, including strains that cause mild upper respiratory tract disease, their role in historic and future pandemics requires ongoing investigation. We review and integrate information on bat-coronavirus interactions at the molecular, tissue, host and population levels. We identify critical gaps in knowledge of bat coronaviruses, which relate to spillover and pandemic risk, including the pathways to zoonotic spillover, the infection dynamics within bat reservoir hosts, the role of prior adaptation in intermediate hosts for zoonotic transmission and the viral genotypes or traits that predict zoonotic capacity and pandemic potential.

The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets and dromedary camels, respectively. No specific treatments or vaccines have been approved against any of the six human coronaviruses, highlighting the need to investigate the principles governing viral entry and cross-species transmission as well as to prepare for zoonotic outbreaks which are likely to occur due to the large reservoir of CoVs found in mammals and birds.

"Bayesian inference of transmission chains using timing of symptoms, pathogen genomes and contact data","Campbell, F; Cori, A; Ferguson, N; Jombart, T","There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring who infected whom' in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.Author summary Reconstructing the history of transmission events in an infectious disease outbreak provides valuable information for informing infection control policy. Recent years have seen considerable progress in the development of statistical tools for the inference of such transmission trees from outbreak data, with a major focus on whole genome sequence data (WGS). However, complex evolutionary behavior, missing sequences and the limited diversity accumulating along transmission chains limit the power of existing approaches in reconstructing outbreaks. We have developed a methodology that uses information on the contact structures between cases to infer likely transmission links, alongside genomic and temporal data. Such contact data is frequently collected in outbreak settings, for example during Ebola, HIV or Tuberculosis outbreaks, and can be highly informative of the infectious relationships between cases. Using simulations, we show that our contact model effectively incorporates this information and improves the accuracy of outbreak reconstruction even when only a portion of contacts are reported. We then apply our method to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with genetic data and contact data for the first time. Our work suggests that, whenever available, contact data should be explicitly incorporated in outbreak reconstruction tools.",2019,,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,15,3,,WOS:000463877900067,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006930,,#25025,Campbell 2019,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2024-02-27 02:12:36)(Select): transmission chain reconstruction / outbreaker 2.

Germs on a Plane: The Transmission and Risks of Airplane-Borne Diseases,"Sevilla, NL","This research explored the role of air travel in the spread of infectious diseases, specifically severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HINI, Ebola, and pneumonic plague. Air travel provides the means for such diseases to spread internationally at extraordinary rates because infected passengers jump from coast to coast and continent to continent within hours. Outbreaks of diseases that spread from person to person test the effectiveness of current public health responses. This research used a mixed methods approach, including use of the Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler, to model the spread of diseases, evaluate the impact of air travel on disease spread, and analyze the effectiveness of different public health strategies and travel policies. Modeling showed that the spread of Ebola and pneumonic plague is minimal and should not be a major air travel concern if an individual becomes infected. HINI and SARS have higher infection rates and air travel will facilitate the spread of disease nationally and internationally. To contain the spread of infectious diseases, aviation and public health authorities should establish tailored preventive measures at airports, capture contact information for ticketed passengers, expand the definition of ""close contact,"" and conduct widespread educational programs.

Pandemic <i>Human Coronavirus</i> - characterization and comparison of selected properties of HCoV-SARS and HCoV-MERS,"Pancer, KW","Two Coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, causing generally mild respiratory tract infections in humans, were described in the XX c. Pandemic Coronaviruses were first discovered as late as in the XXI c.: SARS-HCoV in 2002 - causing severe respiratory tract infections (SARS) in China; MERS-HCoV in 2012 - circulating mostly on the Arabian Peninsula. The SARS epidemic ended in 2004 resulting in morbidity of > 8000 and > 770 deaths, while the MERS epidemic is still ongoing (> 2000 ill, > 700 deaths) although its intensity decreased. Both viruses are zoonotic and require at least two ""host jumps"" for the transmission of the infection to humans: for HCoV-SARS - from bat to palm civet and then to human; for HCoV-MERS - from bats to camels and subsequently to humans. Primary mode of transmission is droplet in close contact (< 1 m), but both viruses remain active in aerosol (up to 24 h), so infection can be also spread by air (ventilation). The ability for human-to-human transmission is higher for HCoV-SARS than for HCoV-MERS (8 generations vs. 4, respectively). Moreover, there are differences in genome structure and pathogenic mechanisms: different receptor, cell entry mechanism, different way of host response modulation (e.g. inhibition of IFN beta cascade), etc. Probably, these differences influence the overall manifestation of the disease in humans. Infection caused by HCoV-MERS might manifest itself as ARDS, a mild-mannered and asymptomatic disease. HCoV-SARS infections seem to be associated with severe disease only. In this paper, a comparison of the structure of these viruses, the mechanisms underlying their ability to cross the interspecies barrier and to multiply in the human body, including modulation of IFN beta cascade, as well as routes of infection transmission and symptoms caused, were presented.",2018,,POSTEPY MIKROBIOLOGII,57,1,22-32,WOS:000429634500004,,,#25050,Pancer 2018,Exclusion reason: Non-english; ,

Little evidence is available about entry and exit screening measure implementation and effectiveness at ports and ground crossings.

Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff,"Verbeek, JH; Rajamaki, B; Ijaz, S; Sauni, R; Toomey, E; Blackwood, B; Tikka, C; Ruotsalainen, JH; Balci, FSK","BackgroundIn epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed.ObjectivesTo evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols.Search methodsWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020.Selection criteriaWe included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted randomeffects meta-analyses were appropriate.Main resultsEarlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design.Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups.Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias.Types of PPEThe use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5).Modified PPE versus standard PPEThe following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31).Donning and doffingUsing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to lessviral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub.TrainingThe use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only.Authors' conclusionsWe found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training.We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.",2020,,COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,,4,,WOS:000529866800031,10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub4,,#25172,Verbeek 2020,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review
How trade affects pandemics? Evidence from severe acute respiratory syndromes in 2003,"Lin, FQ; Wang, XS; Zhou, MH","This paper investigates whether the rapid expansion of international trade after China's WTO entry in 2001 promotes the spread of severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) in 2003. Examining the relationship is helpful to distinguish the hidden costs of trade openness. This paper uses Frankel and Romer (1999, The American Economic Review, 89, 379) framework to construct the geography-based instruments by applying province-country gravity relation for causal identification. Utilising cross-section data of SARS cases of 31 provinces in China, our two-stage least squares regression results show that international trade accelerates the spread of SARS. Cross-country evidence also suggests the causal relation. In addition, we find that the people's inter-provincial mobility driven by trade expansion drives the spread of epidemic diseases.",2022,,WORLD ECONOMY,45,7,2270-2283,WOS:000642187200001,10.1111/twec.13127,,#25284,Lin 2022,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
Autonomous inference of complex network dynamics from incomplete and noisy data,"Gao, TT; Yan, G","The availability of empirical data that capture the structure and behaviour of complex networked systems has been greatly increased in recent years; however, a versatile computational toolbox for unveiling a complex system's nodal and interaction dynamics from data remains elusive. Here we develop a two-phase approach for the autonomous inference of complex network dynamics, and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the tests of inferring neuronal, genetic, social and coupled oscillator dynamics on various synthetic and real networks. Importantly, the approach is robust to incompleteness and noises, including low resolution, observational and dynamical noises, missing and spurious links, and dynamical heterogeneity. We apply the two-phase approach to infer the early spreading dynamics of influenza A flu on the worldwide airline network, and the inferred dynamical equation can also capture the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019.

Epidemiology of Non-SARS-CoV2 Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) in People Presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) in Senegal from 2012 to 2020,"Faye, MN; Barry, MA; Jallow, MM; Wade, SF; Mendy, MP; Sy, S; Fall, A; Kiori, DE; Ndiaye, NK; Goudiaby, D; Diamanka, A; Niang, MN; Dia, N","In addition to emerging coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS, SARS-CoV-2), there are seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs): HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. With a wide distribution around the world, HCoVs are usually associated with mild respiratory disease. In the elderly, young children and immunocompromised patients, more severe or even fatal respiratory infections may be observed. In Africa, data on seasonal HCoV are scarce. This retrospective study investigated the epidemiology and genetic diversity of seasonal HCoVs during nine consecutive years of influenza-like illness surveillance in Senegal. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from ILI outpatients or from SARI hospitalized patients. HCoVs were diagnosed by qRT-PCR and the positive samples were selected for molecular characterization. Among 9337 samples tested for HCoV, 406 (4.3%) were positive: 235 (57.9%) OC43, 102 (25.1%) NL63, 58 (14.3%) 229E and 17 (4.2%) HKU1. The four types circulated during the study period and a peak was noted between November and January. Children under five were the most affected. Co-infections were observed between HCoV types (1.2%) or with other viruses (76.1%). Genetically, HCoVs types showed diversity. The results highlighted that the impact of HCoVs must be taken into account in public health; monitoring them is therefore particularly necessary both in the most sensitive populations and in animals.",2023,,VIRUSES-BASEL,15,1,,WOS:000927276700001,10.3390/v15010020,,#25326,Faye 2023,Exclusion reason: Wrong pathogen/pathogen epidemiology or transmission not the main focus; ,
Multiscale model for the optimal design of pedestrian queues to mitigate infectious disease spread,"Derjany, P; Namilae, S; Liu, DH; Srinivasan, A","There is direct evidence for the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, SARS, measles, and norovirus in locations where large groups of people gather at high densities e.g. theme parks, airports, etc. The mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals in these high people density man-made environments involves pedestrian movement which is generally not taken into account in modeling studies of disease dynamics. We address this problem through a multiscale model that combines pedestrian dynamics with stochastic infection spread models. The pedestrian dynamics model is utilized to generate the trajectories of motion and contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. We incorporate this information into a stochastic infection dynamics model with infection probability and contact radius as primary inputs. This generic model is applicable for several directly transmitted diseases by varying the input parameters related to infectivity and transmission mechanisms. Through this multiscale framework, we estimate the aggregate numbers and probabilities of newly infected people for different winding queue configurations. We find that the queue configuration has a significant impact on disease spread for a range of infection radii and transmission probabilities. We quantify the effectiveness of wall separators in suppressing the disease spread compared to rope separators. Further, we find that configurations with short aisles lower the infection spread when rope separators are used.",2020,,PLOS ONE,15,7,,WOS:000552602700021,10.1371/journal.pone.0235891,,#25415,Derjany 2020,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,

Computational Modeling Framework for the Study of Infectious Disease Spread through Commercial Air-Travel,"IEEE; Derjany, P; Namilae, S; Liu, DH; Srinivasan, A","This paper presents an integrated computational modelling framework combining pedestrian dynamics and infection spread models, to analyse the infectious disease spread during the different stages of air-travel. While, commercial air travel is central to the global mobility of goods and people, it has also been identified as a leading factor in the spread of several epidemic diseases including influenza, SARS and Ebola. The mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals in these high people density locations like airports involves pedestrian movement which needs to be taken into account in the modelling studies of disease dynamics. We develop a Molecular Dynamics based social force modeling approach for pedestrian dynamics and combine it with a stochastic infection dynamics model to evaluate the spread of viral infectious diseases in airplanes and airports. We apply the multiscale model for various key components of air travel and suggest strategies to reduce the number of contacts and the spread of infectious diseases. We simulate pedestrian movement during boarding and deplaning of some typical commercial airplane models and movement of people through security check areas. We found specific boarding strategies that reduce the number of contacts. Further, we find that smaller airplanes are more effective in reducing the number of contacts compared to larger airplanes.

Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff,"Verbeek, JH; Rajamaki, B; Ijaz, S; Tikka, C; Ruotsalainen, JH; Edmond, MB; Sauni, R; Balci, FSK","BackgroundIn epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Contact precautions by means of personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to remove PPE, and how to make sure HCW use PPE as instructed.ObjectivesTo evaluate which type of full body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of self-contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols.Search methodsWe searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 15 July 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL up to 18 June 2019), Scopus (Scopus 18 June 2019), CINAHL (EBSCOhost 31 July 2018), and OSH-Update (up to 31 December 2018). We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews, and contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE.Selection criteriaWe included all controlled studies that compared the effects of PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, such as Ebola or SARS, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included studies that used simulated contamination with fluorescent markers or a non-pathogenic virus.We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training in PPE use on the same outcomes.Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We planned to perform meta-analyses but did not find sufficiently similar studies to combine their results.Main resultsWe included 17 studies with 1950 participants evaluating 21 interventions. Ten studies are Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), one is a quasi RCT and six have a non-randomised controlled design. Two studies are awaiting assessment.Ten studies compared types of PPE but only six of these reported sufficient data. Six studies compared different types of donning and doffing and three studies evaluated different types of training. Fifteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless viruses. In simulation studies, contamination rates varied from 10% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study HCW were exposed to Ebola and in another to SARS.Evidence for all outcomes is based on single studies and is very low quality.Different types of PPEPPE made of more breathable material may not lead to more contamination spots on the trunk (Mean Difference (MD) 1.60 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.15 to 3.35) than more water repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5).Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (MD large patches -1.36 95% CI -1.78 to -0.94).The use of a powered air-purifying respirator may protect better than a simple ensemble of PPE without such respirator (Relative Risk (RR) 0.27; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.43).Five different PPE ensembles (such as gown vs. coverall, boots with or without covers, hood vs. cap, length and number of gloves) were evaluated in one study, but there were no event data available for compared groups.Alterations to PPE design may lead to less contamination such as added tabs to grab masks (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31), a sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), or a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) compared to standard PPE.Different methods of donning and doffing proceduresDouble gloving may lead to less contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78).Following CDC recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (MD small patches -5.44; 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45).Alcohol-based hand rub used during the doffing process may not lead to less contamination than the use of a hypochlorite based solution (MD 4.00; 95% CI 0.47 to 34.24).Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4).Different types of trainingThe use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7).A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70; 95% CI 20.14,41.26) than a traditional lecture.Face to face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only.There were no studies on effects of training in the long term or on resource use.The quality of the evidence is very low for all comparisons because of high risk of bias in all studies, indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants.Authors' conclusionsWe found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. Alterations to PPE, such as tabs to grab may decrease contamination. Double gloving, following CDC doffing guidance, and spoken instructions during doffing may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than video or folder based training. Because data come from single small studies with high risk of bias, we are uncertain about the estimates of effects.We still need randomised controlled trials to find out which training works best in the long term. We need better simulation studies conducted with several dozen participants to find out which PPE protects best, and what is the safest way to remove PPE. Consensus on the best way to conduct simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed.

The results confirm that international tourism is adversely affected by infectious disease risk, and the magnitude of this negative effect is statistically and economically significant. In the case of SARS, for example, a 10% increase in the number of confirmed cases leads, on average, to a reduction of 4.7% in international tourist arrivals. Furthermore, while infectious diseases appear to have a smaller and statistically insignificant negative effect on tourism flows to advanced economies, the magnitude and statistical significance of the impact of infectious diseases are much greater in developing countries, where such diseases tend to be more prevalent and health infrastructure lags behind.",2022,,OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW,33,1,141-156,WOS:000645871900001,10.1007/s11079-021-09619-5,,#25871,Cevik 2022,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
ARPIP: Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction with Insertions and Deletions under the Poisson Indel Process,"Jowkar, G; Pecerska, J; Maiolo, M; Gil, M; Anisimova, M","Modern phylogenetic methods allow inference of ancestral molecular sequences given an alignment and phylogeny relating present-day sequences. This provides insight into the evolutionary history of molecules, helping to understand gene function and to study biological processes such as adaptation and convergent evolution across a variety of applications. Here, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm for fast joint likelihood-based reconstruction of ancestral sequences under the Poisson Indel Process (PIP). Unlike previous approaches, our method, named ARPIP, enables the reconstruction with insertions and deletions based on an explicit indel model. Consequently, inferred indel events have an explicit biological interpretation. Likelihood computation is achieved in linear time with respect to the number of sequences. Our method consists of two steps, namely finding the most probable indel points and reconstructing ancestral sequences. First, we find the most likely indel points and prune the phylogeny to reflect the insertion and deletion events per site. Second, we infer the ancestral states on the pruned subtree in a manner similar to FastML. We applied ARPIP (Ancestral Reconstruction under PIP) on simulated data sets and on real data from the Betacoronavirus genus. ARPIP reconstructs both the indel events and substitutions with a high degree of accuracy. Our method fares well when compared to established state-of-the-art methods such as FastML and PAML. Moreover, the method can be extended to explore both optimal and suboptimal reconstructions, include rate heterogeneity through time and more. We believe it will expand the range of novel applications of ancestral sequence reconstruction.

Costs and benefits of interventions aimed at major infectious disease threats: lessons from the literature,"Kellerborg, K; Brouwer, W; van Baal, P","Pandemics and major outbreaks have the potential to cause large health losses and major economic costs. To prioritize between preventive and responsive interventions, it is important to understand the costs and health losses interventions may prevent. We review the literature, investigating the type of studies performed, the costs and benefits included, and the methods employed against perceived major outbreak threats. We searched PubMed and SCOPUS for studies concerning the outbreaks of SARS in 2003, H5N1 in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, Cholera in Haiti in 2010, MERS-CoV in 2013, H7N9 in 2013, and Ebola in West-Africa in 2014. We screened titles and abstracts of papers, and subsequently examined remaining full-text papers. Data were extracted according to a pre-constructed protocol. We included 34 studies of which the majority evaluated interventions related to the H1N1 outbreak in a high-income setting. Most interventions concerned pharmaceuticals. Included costs and benefits, as well as the methods applied, varied substantially between studies. Most studies used a short time horizon and did not include future costs and benefits. We found substantial variation in the included elements and methods used. Policymakers need to be aware of this and the bias toward high-income countries and pharmaceutical interventions, which hampers generalizability.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.",2020,,LANCET,395,10227,912-920,WOS:000520024900039,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8,,#26779,Brooks 2020,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Christian Morgenstern (2023-12-08 20:59:59)(Screen): Contains review / paper references for SARS.

Human Coronavirus: Host-Pathogen Interaction.,Fung TS; Liu DX,"Human coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes respiratory diseases with mild to severe outcomes. In the last 15 years, we have witnessed the emergence of two zoonotic, highly pathogenic HCoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Replication of HCoV is regulated by a diversity of host factors and induces drastic alterations in cellular structure and physiology. Activation of critical signaling pathways during HCoV infection modulates the induction of antiviral immune response and contributes to the pathogenesis of HCoV. Recent studies have begun to reveal some fundamental aspects of the intricate HCoV-host interaction in mechanistic detail. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of host factors co-opted and signaling pathways activated during HCoV infection, with an emphasis on HCoV-infection-induced stress response, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immunity. The cross talk among these pathways, as well as the modulatory strategies utilized by HCoV, is also discussed.",2019,Sep,Annu Rev Microbiol,73,,529-557,,10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759,31226023,#26958,Fung 2019,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review
Respiratory rehabilitation in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Barman A; Sinha MK; Sahoo J; Jena D; Patel V,"BACKGROUND: With an increase in published reports on respiratory rehabilitation (RR) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is a need for a meta-analysis and systematic review to measure the effects of the RR in SARS. OBJECTIVE: Objective of the review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RR in patients recovering from SARS. METHODS: PubMed/ MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and Clinical Trial Registries were systematically searched (between January 1, 2003, to July 31, 2021) to identify all patients who received RR, at least for six days, following SARS. The primary outcome was exercise capacity [6-meter walking distance (6-MWD)], and secondary outcomes were change in pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters, activities in daily livings (ADLs), and quality of life (QoL). Meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.4. RESULTS: Twenty-one observational studies, including eight comparative studies, were included. Eight comparative studies participated in quantitative meta-analysis. The intervention group, who received RR, improved significantly in exercise capacity (6-MWD) [mean difference (MD):45.79, (95% CI:31.66-59.92)] and PFT parameters, especially in forced vital capacity (FVC%) [MD:4.38, (95% CI:0.15-8.60)], and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) [MD:11.78, (95% CI:5.10-18.46)]. The intervention group failed to demonstrate significant improvement in ADLs and QoL outcomes. No significant adverse events were reported during the intervention. CONCLUSION: Respiratory rehabilitation can improve exercise capacity and PFT parameters in patients recovering from SARS infection. The RR does not cause serious adverse events. Clinical trials to determine the best RR program (in terms of initiation, duration, and components) in SARS and its treatment efficacy, both in the short and long- term are needed.",2022,May-Jun,Heart Lung,53,,Nov-24,,10.1016/j.hrtlng.2022.01.005,35108624,#26993,Barman 2022,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; ,SARS review
What we have learnt from the SARS epdemics in mainland China?,Cao W; Fang L; Xiao D,"This article provides an overview of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in mainland China and of what we have learned since the outbreak. The epidemics spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two regions: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing and its surrounding areas. The resulting case fatality ratio of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries and regions, partly due to younger-aged patients and a higher proportion of community-acquired infections. Strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response were most important for controlling SARS. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited. Many recovered patients suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, as a consequence of corticosteroid usage during their infection. The SARS epidemic provided valuable experience and lessons relevant in controlling outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and has led to fundamental reforms of the Chinese health system. Additionally, the epidemic has substantially improved infrastructures, surveillance systems, and capacity to response to health emergencies. In particular, a comprehensive nationwide internet-based disease reporting system was established.",2019,Sep,Glob Health J,3,3,55-59,,10.1016/j.glohj.2019.09.003,32501415,#27082,Cao 2019,Exclusion reason: Retracted; Christian Morgenstern (2023-12-14 02:46:31)(Select): This article has been retracted; ,

Analysis and Optimal Control of Fractional-Order Transmission of a Respiratory Epidemic Model.,Yaro D; Apeanti WO; Akuamoah SW; Lu D,"The World Health Organization is yet to realise the global aim of achieving future-free and eliminating the transmission of respiratory diseases such as H1N1, SARS and Ebola since the recent reemergence of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In this paper, a Caputo fractional-order derivative is applied to a system of non-integer order differential equation to model the transmission dynamics of respiratory diseases. The nonnegative solutions of the system are obtained by using the Generalized Mean Value Theorem. The next generation matrix approach is used to obtain the basic reproduction number R0 . We discuss the stability of the disease-free equilibrium when R0 < 1 , and the necessary conditions for the stability of the endemic equilibrium when R0 > 1 . A sensitivity analysis shows that R0 is most sensitive to the probability of the disease transmission rate. The results from the numerical simulations of optimal control strategies disclose that the utmost way of controlling or probably eradicating the transmission of respiratory diseases should be quarantining the exposed individuals, monitoring and treating infected people for a substantial period.",2019,,Int J Appl Comput Math,5,4,116,,10.1007/s40819-019-0699-7,32289049,#27098,Yaro 2019,"Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; Christian Morgenstern (2023-12-14 00:36:00)(Select): Don't fit to SARS data, model only; ",transmission model
Depression and Elevated Inflammation Among Chinese Older Adults: Eight Years After the 2003 SARS Epidemic.,Wang H; Stokes JE; Burr JA,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study examined associations between exposure to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and Chinese older adults' depression and inflammation 8 years after the crisis. Further, this study investigated the buffering effects of perceived social support and social participation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the 2011 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey, including N = 4,341 Chinese adults aged 60 years and older. For the survey, local officials identified whether the 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the major disasters in the history of their communities. Depression was assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale and inflammation was measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) collected from participants via venous blood draws. RESULTS: Results from multilevel logistic regression models revealed that Chinese older adults living in communities exposed to SARS were more likely to have elevated CRP compared to those not living in such communities. Moreover, community SARS exposure was associated with greater risks of depression for Chinese older adults who had no perceived social support. Among Chinese older adults who had low levels of social participation, community SARS exposure was more strongly related to elevated CRP. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest community-level exposure to the SARS epidemic had enduring consequences for Chinese older adults' health. However, active social participation and supportive social ties provided important resources that may buffer against negative effects of exposure to the SARS epidemic.",2021,Feb,Gerontologist,61,2,273-283,,10.1093/geront/gnaa219,33599268,#27133,Wang 2021,Exclusion reason: No parameters of interest/transmission models/historical outbreaks; ,
An integrative review of the limited evidence on international travel bans as an emerging infectious disease disaster control measure.,Errett NA; Sauer LM; Rutkow L,"In our increasingly interconnected world, the potential for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) to spread globally is of paramount concern. Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.",2020,Jan/Feb,J Emerg Manag,18,1,Jul-14,,10.5055/jem.2020.0446,32031668,#27152,Errett 2020,Exclusion reason: No original estimates/primary data; Thomas Rawson (2023-12-15 04:59:57)(Select): I can't access the paper; ,SARS review

"Transmission, Pathological Mechanism and Pathogenesis of SARS-1 and SARS-2","Al-Taee, SK; Mostafa, ES; Al-Saidya, AM","THE coronavirus is an etiological agent of affects both animals and humans. Sever acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2) and (SARS-1) are caused by two viruses belonging to subgenus beta-coronavirus. SARS-1 and SARS-2 are considered zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to human causing epidemic SARS-1 and pandemic SARS-2. In animals and humans both viruses have a tropism binding receptors the ACE2 which is the entry site for host cells. In animal virus affected all aged and cause disturbances in all organs but main clinical signs are respiratory disorder with development some complications and organs failure functions in advance cases. Similarity of both SARS-1 and SARS-2 resulted in thrombus formation accompanied with elevated d-dimer, increase fibrin formation and long time for prothrombin. Inaddition neurological disorder and olfactory dysfunction was detected in SARS-2. This review focused on the coronavirus transmission, host defense mechanisms, pathophysiology and pathogenesis.
