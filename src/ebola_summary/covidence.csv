Transmission network of the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone,"Yang, W.; Zhang, W.; Kargbo, D.; Yang, R.; Chen, Y.; Chen, Z.; Kamara, A.; Kargbo, B.; Kandula, S.; Karspeck, A.; Liu, C.; Shaman, J.","Understanding the growth and spatial expansion of (re)emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola and avian influenza, is critical for the effective planning of control measures; however, such efforts are often compromised by data insufficiencies and observational errors. Here, we develop a spatial-temporal inference methodology using a modified network model in conjunction with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, a Bayesian inference method equipped to handle observational errors. The combined method is capable of revealing the spatial-temporal progression of infectious disease, while requiring only limited, readily compiled data. We use this method to reconstruct the transmission network of the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone and identify source and sink regions. Our inference suggests that, in Sierra Leone, transmission within the network introduced Ebola to neighbouring districts and initiated self-sustaining local epidemics; two of the more populous and connected districts, Kenema and Port Loko, facilitated two independent transmission pathways. Epidemic intensity differed by district, was highly correlated with population size (r = 0.76, p = 0.0015) and a critical window of opportunity for containing local Ebola epidemics at the source (ca one month) existed. This novel methodology can be used to help identify and contain the spatial expansion of future (re)emerging infectious disease outbreaks.",2015,Nov 6,J R Soc Interface,12,112,,26559683,10.1098/rsif.2015.0536,,#30,Yang 2015,"",""
Clinical characteristics of 154 patients suspected of having Ebola virus disease in the Ebola holding center of Jui Government Hospital in Sierra Leone during the 2014 Ebola outbreak,"Yan, T.; Mu, J.; Qin, E.; Wang, Y.; Liu, L.; Wu, D.; Jia, H.; Li, Z.; Guo, T.; Wang, X.; Qin, Y.; Li, Y.; Chen, S.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, J.; Wu, Y.; Wang, S.; Li, J.","This article sought to analyze the clinical features of 154 patients suspected of having Ebola virus disease (EVD) in an Ebola holding center in Sierra Leone from October 1 through November 9, 2014. We found that 108 of the 154 patients were confirmed with EVD. Eighty-five had known outcomes. Forty-nine of the 85 patients had been exposed to EVD. The average mortality rate was 60%. The mean interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 5.8 +/- 3.3 days. The mean incubation period was 9.2 +/- 6.7 days. Common symptoms of the EVD patients on admission were fatigue (85.2%), anorexia (84.3%), fever (75.9%), and headache (72.2%). Our data showed that the total symptoms of confirmed EVD patients were significantly higher than those of non-EVD patients (9 vs. 5.5; p < 0.001). The likelihood of EVD was 87.6% when a patient presented more than 6 out of 21 symptoms on admission. The survivors were significantly younger than non-survivors (24.0 +/- 10.0 years vs. 31.3 +/- 15.3 years; p = 0.016). The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that, in the survivors, the virus load was significantly lower (Ct value: 25.2 +/- 4.1 vs. 28.7 +/- 5.7; p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that age, fever, and viral load were independent predictors of mortality. Taken together, our data suggested that a cutoff of six symptoms could be used to predict patients with high or low risk of EVD. It seemed that age, fever, and viral load were the main risk factors associated with EVD mortality.",2015,Oct,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,34,10,2089-95,26223324,10.1007/s10096-015-2457-z,,#41,Yan 2015,"",""
Effect of Ebola progression on transmission and control in Liberia,"Yamin, D.; Gertler, S.; Ndeffo-Mbah, M. L.; Skrip, L. A.; Fallah, M.; Nyenswah, T. G.; Altice, F. L.; Galvani, A. P.","BACKGROUND: The Ebola outbreak that is sweeping across West Africa is the largest, most volatile, and deadliest Ebola epidemic ever recorded. Liberia is the most profoundly affected country, with more than 3500 infections and 2000 deaths recorded in the past 3 months. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of disease progression and case fatality on transmission and to examine the potential for targeted interventions to eliminate the disease. DESIGN: Stochastic transmission model that integrates epidemiologic and clinical data on incidence and case fatality, daily viral load among survivors and nonsurvivors evaluated on the basis of the 2000-2001 outbreak in Uganda, and primary data on contacts of patients with Ebola in Liberia. SETTING: Montserrado County, Liberia, July to September 2014. MEASUREMENTS: Ebola incidence and case-fatality records from 2014 Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. RESULTS: The average number of secondary infections generated throughout the entire infectious period of a single infected case, R, was estimated as 1.73 (95% CI, 1.66 to 1.83). There was substantial stratification between survivors (RSurvivors), for whom the estimate was 0.66 (CI, 0.10 to 1.69), and nonsurvivors (RNonsurvivors), for whom the estimate was 2.36 (CI, 1.72 to 2.80). The nonsurvivors had the highest risk for transmitting the virus later in the course of disease progression. Consequently, the isolation of 75% of infected individuals in critical condition within 4 days from symptom onset has a high chance of eliminating the disease. LIMITATION: Projections are based on the initial dynamics of the epidemic, which may change as the outbreak and interventions evolve. CONCLUSION: These results underscore the importance of isolating the most severely ill patients with Ebola within the first few days of their symptomatic phase.

Modeling the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease in Liberia,"Xia, Z. Q.; Wang, S. F.; Li, S. L.; Huang, L. Y.; Zhang, W. Y.; Sun, G. Q.; Gai, Z.

The 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa is the largest ever, which has caused a large number of deaths and the most serious country is Liberia during the outbreak period. Based on the data released by World Health Organization and the actual transmission situations, we investigate the impact of different transmission routes on the EVD outbreak in Liberia and estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.012 in the absence of effective control measures. Through sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, we reveal that the transmission coefficients of suspected and probable cases have stronger correlations on the basic reproduction number. Furthermore, we study the influence of control measures (isolation and safe burial measures) on EVD outbreak. It is found that if combined control measures are taken, the basic reproduction number will be less than one and thus EVD in Liberia may be well contained. The obtained results may provide new guidance to prevent and control the spread of disease.",2015,Sep 8,Sci Rep,5,,13857,26347015,10.1038/srep13857,,#65,Xia 2015,"",""

A one-year effective reproduction number of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreaks in the widespread West African countries and quantitative evaluation of air travel restriction measure,"Wiratsudakul, A.; Triampo, W.; Laosiritaworn, Y.; Modchang, C.","BACKGROUND: The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest and longest Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the history, and the virus has escaped across countries and continents via air travel in this outbreak. METHOD: The interpolated data from WHO Ebola situation reports were used to estimate number of weekly infectious individuals and daily effective reproduction numbers (Rt) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A stochastic dynamic model was performed to estimate the risk of EVD importation into the top 20 final destination countries of air travelers departing from within the three epidemic countries, and the effectiveness of air travel restriction was subsequently evaluated. RESULTS: The daily Rt was estimated at 0.72-1.32 in Guinea, 0.62-1.38 in Liberia and 0.81-1.38 in Sierra Leone. The peak of EVD importation probability was observed in early November 2014 and the restriction of air travel may mitigate the risk up to 67.7% (95% CI 66.6-68.7).

Surviving Ebola: A historical cohort study of Ebola mortality and survival in Sierra Leone 2014-2015,"Wing, K.; Oza, S.; Houlihan, C.; Glynn, J. R.; Irvine, S.; Warrell, C. E.; Simpson, A. J.

R.","BACKGROUND: While a number of predictors for Ebola mortality have been identified, less is known about post-viral symptoms. The identification of acute-illness predictors for post-viral symptoms could allow the selection of patients for more active follow up in the future, and those in whom early interventions may be beneficial in the long term. Studying predictors of both mortality and post-viral symptoms within a single cohort of patients could also further our understanding of the pathophysiology of survivor sequelae. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a historical cohort study using data collected as part of routine clinical care from an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, in order to identify predictors of mortality and of post-viral symptoms. Variables included as potential predictors were sex, age, date of admission, first recorded viral load at the ETC and symptoms (recorded upon presentation at the ETC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors. Of 263 Ebola-confirmed patients admitted between November 2014 and March 2015, 151 (57%) survived to ETC discharge. Viral load was the strongest predictor of mortality (adjusted OR comparing high with low viral load: 84.97, 95% CI 30.87-345.94). We did not find evidence that a high viral load predicted post-viral symptoms (ocular: 1.17, 95% CI 0.35-3.97; musculoskeletal: 1.07, 95% CI 0.28-4.08). Ocular post-viral symptoms were more common in females (2.31, 95% CI 0.98-5.43) and in those who had experienced hiccups during the acute phase (4.73, 95% CI 0.90-24.73).

T.; Palacios, G.; Stroher, U.","Following cessation of continuous Ebola virus (EBOV) transmission within Western Africa, sporadic EBOV disease (EVD) cases continued to re-emerge beyond the viral incubation period. Epidemiological and genomic evidence strongly suggests that this represented transmission from EVD survivors. To investigate whether persistent infections are characterized by ongoing viral replication, we sequenced EBOV from the semen of nine EVD survivors and a subset of corresponding acute specimens. EBOV evolutionary rates during persistence were either similar to or reduced relative to acute infection rates. Active EBOV replication/transcription continued during convalescence, but decreased over time, consistent with viral persistence rather than viral latency. Patterns of genetic divergence suggest a moderate relaxation of selective constraints within the sGP carboxy-terminal tail during persistent infections, but do not support widespread diversifying selection. Altogether, our data illustrate that EBOV persistence in semen, urine, and aqueous humor is not a quiescent or latent infection.",2018,Jan 30,Cell Rep,22,5,1159-1168,29386105,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.01.008,,#199,Whitmer 2018,"",""
Projected treatment capacity needs in sierra leone,"White, R. A.; MacDonald, E.; de Blasio, B. F.; Nygard, K.; Vold, L.; Rottingen, J. A.","BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa requires immediate and sustained input from the international community in order to curb transmission. The CDC has produced a model that indicates that to end the outbreak by pushing the reproductive number below one, 25% of the patients must be placed in an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETC) and 45% must be isolated in community settings in which risk of disease transmission is reduced and safe burials are provided. In order to provide firmer targets for the international response in Sierra Leone, we estimated the national and international personnel and treatment capacity that may be required to reach these percentages. METHODS: We developed a compartmental SEIR model that was fitted to WHO data and local data allowing the reproductive number to change every 8 weeks to forecast the progression of the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone. We used the previously estimated 2.5x correction factor estimated by the CDC to correct for underreporting. Number of personnel required to provide treatment for the predicted number of cases was estimated using UNMEER and UN OCHA requests for resources required to meet the CDC target of 70% isolation. RESULTS: As of today (2014-12-04), we estimate that there are 810 (95% CI=646 to 973) EVD active cases in treatment, with an additional 3751 (95% CI=2778 to 4723) EVD cases unreported and untreated. To reach the CDC targets today, we need 1140 (95% CI=894 to 1387) cases in ETCs and 2052 (95% CI=1608 to 2496) at home or in a community setting with a reduced risk for disease transmission. In 28 days (2015-01-01), we will need 1309 (95% CI=804 to 1814) EVD cases in ETCs and 2356 (95% CI=1447 to 3266) EVD cases at reduced risk of transmission. If the current transmission rate is not reduced, up to 3183 personnel in total will be required in 56 days (2015-01-29) to operate ETCs according to our model. CONCLUSIONS: The current outbreak will require massive input from the international community in order to curb the transmission through traditional containment mechanisms by breaking the chains of transmission in Sierra Leone. If sufficient treatment facilities, healthcare workers and support personnel are not rapidly deployed, the increasing number of cases will be overwhelming.In addition to supporting isolation and treatment mechanisms, other viable control options, such as the development of an effective vaccine, should be supported.",2015,Jan 30,PLoS Curr,7,,,25685632,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.3c3477556808e44cf41d2511b21dc29f,,#206,White 2015,"",""

Phylodynamic analysis of ebola virus in the 2014 sierra leone epidemic,"Volz, E.; Pond, S.","BACKGROUND: The Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in Western Africa is the largest in recorded history and control efforts have so far failed to stem the rapid growth in the number of infections. Mathematical models serve a key role in estimating epidemic growth rates and the reproduction number (R0) from surveillance data and, recently, molecular sequence data. Phylodynamic analysis of existing EBOV time-stamped sequence data may provide independent estimates of the unobserved number of infections, reveal recent epidemiological history, and provide insight into selective pressures acting upon viral genes. METHODS: We fit a series mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics to phylogenies estimated from 78 whole EBOV genomes collected from distinct patients in May and June of 2014 in Sierra Leone, and perform evolutionary analysis on these genomes combined with closely related EBOV genomes from previous outbreaks. Two analyses are conducted with values of the latent period that have been used in recent modelling efforts. We also examined the EBOV sequences for evidence of possible episodic adaptive molecular evolution during the 2014 outbreak. RESULTS: We find evidence for adaptive evolution affecting L and GP protein coding regions of the EBOV genome, which is unlikely to bias molecular clock and phylodynamic analyses. We estimate R0=2.40 (95% HPD:1.54-3.87 ) if the mean latent period is 5.3 days, and R0=3.81, (95% HPD:2.47-6.3) if the mean latent period is 12.7 days. The estimated coefficient of variation (CV) of the number of transmissions per infected host is very high, and a large proportion of infections yield no transmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of R0 are sensitive to the unknown latent infectious period which can not be reliably estimated from genetic data alone.

We develop a simple mathematical model that incorporates contact transmission and sexual transmission parametrized from data relating to the 2013-2015 West African Ebola epidemic. The model explores scenarios where contact transmission is reduced following infection events, capturing behaviour change, and quantifies how these actions reducing transmission may be compromised by sexual transmission in terms of increasing likelihood, size and duration of outbreaks. We characterize the extent to which sexual transmission operates in terms of the probability of initial infection resolving to sexual infectiousness and the sexual transmission rate, and relate these parameters to the overall case burden. We find that sexual transmission can have large effects on epidemic dynamics (increasing attack ratios from 25% in scenarios without sexual transmission but with contact-transmission-reducing behaviour, up to 80% in equivalent scenarios with sexual transmission).",2016,Jun,Biol Lett,12,6,,27277951,10.1098/rsbl.2015.1079,,#315,Vinson 2016,"",""

A Bayesian Belief Network Model Assessing the Risk to Wastewater Workers of Contracting Ebola Virus Disease During an Outbreak,"Zabinski, J. W.; Pieper, K. J.; Gibson, J. M.","During an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), hospitals' connections to municipal wastewater systems may provide a path for patient waste bearing infectious viral particles to pass from the hospital into the wastewater treatment system, potentially posing risks to sewer and wastewater workers. To quantify these risks, we developed a Bayesian belief network model incorporating data on virus behavior and survival along with structural characteristics of hospitals and wastewater treatment systems. We applied the model to assess risks under several different scenarios of workers' exposure to wastewater for a wastewater system typical of a mid-sized U.S. city. The model calculates a median daily risk of developing EVD of approximately 6.1x10(-12) (90% confidence interval: 1.0x10(-12) to 5.4x10(-9) ; mean 1.8x10(-6) ) when no prior exposure conditions are specified. Under a worst-case scenario in which a worker stationed in the sewer adjacent to the hospital accidentally ingests several drops (0.35 mL) of wastewater, median risk is 5.8x10(-4) (90% CI: 8.8x10(-7) to 9.5x10(-2) ; mean 3.2x10(-2) ) . Disinfection of patient waste with peracetic acid for 15 minutes prior to flushing decreases the estimated median risk to 3.8x10(-7) (90% CI: 4.1x10(-9) to 8.6x10(-5) ; mean 2.9x10(-5) ).

A generalized-growth model to characterize the early ascending phase of infectious disease outbreaks,"Viboud, C.; Simonsen, L.; Chowell, G.","BACKGROUND: A better characterization of the early growth dynamics of an epidemic is needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission, refine existing transmission models, and improve disease forecasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a 2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data representing a variety of viral pathogens in historic and contemporary populations, and provide simulations highlighting the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. RESULTS: We applied the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918 pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone had near-exponential growth, while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed near constant incidences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a common phenomenon, especially for pathogens that are not airborne. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes, or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of ""deceleration parameters"" may be useful to refine existing mathematical transmission models and improve disease forecasts.",2016,Jun,Epidemics,15,,27-37,27266847,10.1016/j.epidem.2016.01.002,,#442,Viboud 2016,"",""

The establishment of well-equipped diagnostic laboratories close to Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) has made it possible to obtain relevant virological and biological data during the course of EVD and to assess their association with the clinical course and different outcomes of the disease. METHODS. We were responsible for diagnosing EBOV infection in patients admitted to two ETCs in forested areas of Guinea.

Biochemical analyses were also performed. RESULTS. We handled samples from 168 patients between November 29, 2014, and January 31, 2015; 97 patients were found to be infected with EBOV, with Plasmodium falciparum coinfection in 18%. Overall mortality for EVD cases was 58%, rising to 86% if P. falciparum was also present. Viral load was higher in fatal cases of EVD than in survivors, and fatal cases were associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 levels. Furthermore, regardless of outcome, EVD was characterized by higher creatine kinase (CPK), amylase, and creatinine levels than in febrile patients without EVD, with higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in fatal cases of EVD only. CONCLUSION. These findings suggest that a high viral load at admission is a marker of poor EVD prognosis. In addition, high AST, ALT, CRP, and IL-6 levels are associated with a fatal outcome of EVD. Damage to the liver and other tissues, with massive rhabdomyolysis and, probably, acute pancreatitis, is associated with EVD and correlated with disease severity. Finally, biochemical analyses provide substantial added value at ETCs, making it possible to improve supportive rehydration and symptomatic care for patients. FUNDING.

Using data-driven agent-based models for forecasting emerging infectious diseases,"Venkatramanan, S.; Lewis, B.; Chen, J.; Higdon, D.; Vullikanti, A.; Marathe, M.","Producing timely, well-informed and reliable forecasts for an ongoing epidemic of an emerging infectious disease is a huge challenge. Epidemiologists and policy makers have to deal with poor data quality, limited understanding of the disease dynamics, rapidly changing social environment and the uncertainty on effects of various interventions in place. Under this setting, detailed computational models provide a comprehensive framework for integrating diverse data sources into a well-defined model of disease dynamics and social behavior, potentially leading to better understanding and actions. In this paper, we describe one such agent-based model framework developed for forecasting the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, and subsequently used during the Ebola forecasting challenge.

Predicting Subnational Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic Dynamics from Sociodemographic Indicators,"Valeri, L.; Patterson-Lomba, O.; Gurmu, Y.; Ablorh, A.; Bobb, J.; Townes, F. W.; Harling, G.","BACKGROUND: The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has spread wider than any previous human EVD epidemic. While individual-level risk factors that contribute to the spread of EVD have been studied, the population-level attributes of subnational regions associated with outbreak severity have not yet been considered. METHODS: To investigate the area-level predictors of EVD dynamics, we integrated time series data on cumulative reported cases of EVD from the World Health Organization and covariate data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. We first estimated the early growth rates of epidemics in each second-level administrative district (ADM2) in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia using exponential, logistic and polynomial growth models. We then evaluated how these growth rates, as well as epidemic size within ADM2s, were ecologically associated with several demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the ADM2, using bivariate correlations and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: The polynomial growth model appeared to best fit the ADM2 epidemic curves, displaying the lowest residual standard error. Each outcome was associated with various regional characteristics in bivariate models, however in stepwise multivariable models only mean education levels were consistently associated with a worse local epidemic. DISCUSSION: By combining two common methods-estimation of epidemic parameters using mathematical models, and estimation of associations using ecological regression models-we identified some factors predicting rapid and severe EVD epidemics in West African subnational regions. While care should be taken interpreting such results as anything more than correlational, we suggest that our approach of using data sources that were publicly available in advance of the epidemic or in real-time provides an analytic framework that may assist countries in understanding the dynamics of future outbreaks as they occur.",2016,,PLoS One,11,10,e0163544,27732614,10.1371/journal.pone.0163544,,#505,Valeri 2016,Anne Cori (2019-10-30 22:43:58)(Select): they have an estimated growth rate in the supplement; ,""

We used network visualization to investigate EVD transmission chains (TC) in seven sub-prefectures of N'Zerekore in order to adapt outbreak response. METHODS: Between August 2014 and February 2015, the EVD outbreak response team including the World Health Organization (WHO) and local health authorities routinely collected information among new cases regarding hospital visits, cases within a household, participation in burials, as well as dates of symptom onset, serial intervals (SI) and exposure to EVD. SI's were defined as the interval between symptom onset in an index case and symptom onset in a secondary case infected by that index case. Cases who reported hospital visits, contact with a case in the household or participating in burials were attributed to these exposures. RESULTS: We identified seven TC (two urban and five rural) gathering characteristics of 109 probable/confirmed cases. Overall, 61% (66 cases, SI range: 7-20 days) were household related, 32% (35 cases, SI range 8-30 days) were household or burial related and 7% (8 cases, SI range: 4-20 days) were hospital-related. In the urban chains (18 cases, SI range: 7-20 days), 12 cases were household related and 6 cases were hospital related, none where household or burial related. In the rural chains (84 cases, SI range: 7-30 days), 60% (50 cases) were household related, 1% (1 case) was hospital related and 39% (34 cases) were household or burial related. No cases reported multiple exposures.

Predicting the extinction of Ebola spreading in Liberia due to mitigation strategies,"Valdez, L. D.; Aragao Rego, H. H.; Stanley, H. E.; Braunstein, L. A.","The Ebola virus is spreading throughout West Africa and is causing thousands of deaths. In order to quantify the effectiveness of different strategies for controlling the spread, we develop a mathematical model in which the propagation of the Ebola virus through Liberia is caused by travel between counties. For the initial months in which the Ebola virus spreads, we find that the arrival times of the disease into the counties predicted by our model are compatible with World Health Organization data, but we also find that reducing mobility is insufficient to contain the epidemic because it delays the arrival of Ebola virus in each county by only a few weeks. We study the effect of a strategy in which safe burials are increased and effective hospitalisation instituted under two scenarios: (i) one implemented in mid-July 2014 and (ii) one in mid-August--which was the actual time that strong interventions began in Liberia. We find that if scenario (i) had been pursued the lifetime of the epidemic would have been three months shorter and the total number of infected individuals 80% less than in scenario (ii).

Exploring the contribution of exposure heterogeneity to the cessation of the 2014 Ebola epidemic,"Uekermann, F.; Simonsen, L.; Sneppen, K.","The unexpected early cessation of the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak demonstrated shortcomings of popular forecasting approaches and has not been fully understood yet. A popular hypothesis is that public health interventions mitigated the spread, such as ETUs and safe burials. We investigate whether risk heterogeneity within the population could serve as an alternative explanation. We introduce a model for spread in heterogeneous host population that is particularly well suited for early predictions due to its simplicity and ease of application. Furthermore, we explore the conditions under which the observed epidemic trajectory can be explained without taking into account the effect of public health interventions. While the obtained fits closely match the total case count time series, closer inspection of sub-population results made us conclude that risk heterogeneity is unlikely to fully explain the early cessation of Ebola; other factors such as behavioral changes and other interventions likely played a major role. More accurate predictions in a future scenario require models that allow for early sub-exponential growth, as well as access to additional data on patient occupation (risk level) and location, to allow identify local phenomena that influence spreading behavior.",2019,,PLoS One,14,2,e0210638,30707729,10.1371/journal.pone.0210638,,#525,Uekermann 2019,"",""
The IDEA model: A single equation approach to the Ebola forecasting challenge,"Tuite, A. R.; Fisman, D.

The RAPIDD Ebola Forecasting Challenge (REFC) tested the ability of eight mathematical models to generate useful forecasts in the face of simulated Ebola outbreaks. We used a simple, phenomenological single-equation model (the ""IDEA"" model), which relies only on case counts, in the REFC. Model fits were performed using a maximum likelihood approach. We found that the model performed reasonably well relative to other more complex approaches, with performance metrics ranked on average 4th or 5th among participating models. IDEA appeared better suited to long- than short-term forecasts, and could be fit using nothing but reported case counts. Several limitations were identified, including difficulty in identifying epidemic peak (even retrospectively), unrealistically precise confidence intervals, and difficulty interpolating daily case counts when using a model scaled to epidemic generation time. More realistic confidence intervals were generated when case counts were assumed to follow a negative binomial, rather than Poisson, distribution.

Residents of Tonkolili district who presented between 12 September 2014 and 23 February 2015 to the district EMC and the two distant EMCs were identified from EMC line-lists. EVD cases were confirmed by a positive Ebola PCR test. We calculated time to admission since the onset of symptoms, case-fatality and adjusted Risk Ratios (aRR) using Binomial regression.

Stochasticity and the limits to confidence when estimating R0 of Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases,"Taylor, B. P.; Dushoff, J.; Weitz, J. S.","Dynamic models - often deterministic in nature - were used to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of the 2014-5 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic outbreak in West Africa. Estimates of R0 were then used to project the likelihood for large outbreak sizes, e.g., exceeding hundreds of thousands of cases. Yet fitting deterministic models can lead to over-confidence in the confidence intervals of the fitted R0, and, in turn, the type and scope of necessary interventions. In this manuscript we propose a hybrid stochastic-deterministic method to estimate R0 and associated confidence intervals (CIs). The core idea is that stochastic realizations of an underlying deterministic model can be used to evaluate the compatibility of candidate values of R0 with observed epidemic curves. The compatibility is based on comparing the distribution of expected epidemic growth rates with the observed epidemic growth rate given ""process noise"", i.e., arising due to stochastic transmission, recovery and death events. By applying our method to reported EVD case counts from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we show that prior estimates of R0 based on deterministic fits appear to be more confident than analysis of stochastic trajectories suggests should be possible. Moving forward, we recommend including process noise among other sources of noise when estimating R0 CIs of emerging epidemics.

Here, we examine one component of Ebola dynamics that is of ongoing concern - the transmission of Ebola from the dead to the living. We do so by applying the toolkit of mathematical epidemiology to analyze the consequences of post-death transmission. We show that underlying disease parameters cannot be inferred with confidence from early-stage incidence data (that is, they are not ""identifiable"") because different parameter combinations can produce virtually the same epidemic trajectory. Despite this identifiability problem, we find robustly that inferences that don't account for post-death transmission tend to underestimate the basic reproductive number - thus, given the observed rate of epidemic growth, larger amounts of post-death transmission imply larger reproductive numbers. From a control perspective, we explain how improvements in reducing post-death transmission of Ebola may reduce the overall epidemic spread and scope substantially. Increased attention to the proportion of post-death transmission has the potential to aid both in projecting the course of the epidemic and in evaluating a portfolio of control strategies.",2015,Mar 4,Sci Rep,5,,8751,25736239,10.1038/srep08751,,#676,Weitz 2015,"",""

Based on viral genetic sequencing data from 72 individuals in Sierra Leone collected between the end of May and mid June, we utilize a range of phylodynamic methods to estimate the basic reproductive number (R0). We additionally estimate the expected lengths of the incubation and infectious periods of the virus. Finally, we use phylogenetic trees to examine the role played by population structure in the epidemic. RESULTS: The median estimates of R0 based on sequencing data alone range between 1.65-2.18, with the most plausible model yielding a median R0 of 2.18 (95% HPD 1.24-3.55). Importantly, our results indicate that, at least until mid June, relief efforts in Sierra Leone were ineffective at lowering the effective reproductive number of the virus. We estimate the expected length of the infectious period to be 2.58 days (median; 95% HPD 1.24-6.98). The dataset appears to be too small in order to estimate the incubation period with high certainty (median expected incubation period 4.92 days; 95% HPD 2.11-23.20). While our estimates of the duration of infection tend to be smaller than previously reported, phylodynamic analyses support a previous estimate that 70% of cases were observed and included in the present dataset. The dataset is too small to show a particular population structure with high significance, however our preliminary analyses suggest that half the population is spreading the virus with an R0 well above 2, while the other half of the population is spreading with an R0 below 1. CONCLUSIONS: Overall we show that sequencing data can robustly infer key epidemiological parameters. Such estimates inform public health officials and help to coordinate effective public health efforts. Thus having more sequencing data available for the ongoing Ebola virus epidemic and at the start of new outbreaks will foster a quick understanding of the dynamics of the pathogen.",2014,Oct 6,PLoS Curr,6,,,25642370,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.02bc6d927ecee7bbd33532ec8ba6a25f,,#865,Stadler 2014,"",""
Forecasting and control policy assessment for the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone using small-world networked model simulations,"Siettos, C. I.; Anastassopoulou, C.; Russo, L.; Grigoras, C.; Mylonakis, E.","OBJECTIVES: As the Ebola virus disease is still sustained in Sierra Leone, we analysed the epidemic for a recent period (21 December 2014 to 17 April 2015) using a small-world networked model and forecasted its evolution. Policy-control scenarios for the containment of the epidemic were also examined. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model with 6 million individuals (the population of Sierra Leone) interacting through a small-world social network. The model incorporates the main epidemiological factors, including the effect of burial practices to virus transmission. The effective reproductive number (Re) was evaluated directly from the agent-based simulations. Estimates of the epidemiological variables were computed on the basis of the official cases as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RESULTS: From 21 December 2014 to 18 February 2015 the epidemic was in recession compared with previous months, as indicated by the estimated Re of approximately 0.77 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.82). From 18 February to 17 April 2015, the Re rose above criticality ( approximately 1.98, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.22), flashing a note of caution for the situation. By projecting in time, we predicted that the epidemic would continue through July 2015. Our predictions were close to the cases reported by CDC by the end of June, verifying the criticality of the situation. In light of these developments, while revising our manuscript, we expanded our analysis to include the most recent data (until 15 August 2015). By mid-August, Re had fallen below criticality and the epidemic was expected to fade out by early December 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Our results call for the continuation of drastic control measures, which in the absence of an effective vaccine or therapy at present can only translate to isolation of the infected section of the population, to contain the epidemic.",2016,Jan 29,BMJ Open,6,1,e008649,26826143,10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008649,,#885,Siettos 2016,"",""
"Modeling the 2014 Ebola Virus Epidemic - Agent-Based Simulations, Temporal Analysis and Future Predictions for Liberia and Sierra Leone","Siettos, C.; Anastassopoulou, C.; Russo, L.; Grigoras, C.; Mylonakis, E.","We developed an agent-based model to investigate the epidemic dynamics of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia and Sierra Leone from May 27 to December 21, 2014. The dynamics of the agent-based simulator evolve on small-world transmission networks of sizes equal to the population of each country, with adjustable densities to account for the effects of public health intervention policies and individual behavioral responses to the evolving epidemic. Based on time series of the official case counts from the World Health Organization (WHO), we provide estimates for key epidemiological variables by employing the so-called Equation-Free approach. The underlying transmission networks were characterized by rather random structures in the two countries with densities decreasing by ~19% from the early (May 27-early August) to the last period (mid October-December 21). Our estimates for the values of key epidemiological variables, such as the mean time to death, recovery and the case fatality rate, are very close to the ones reported by the WHO Ebola response team during the early period of the epidemic (until September 14) that were calculated based on clinical data. Specifically, regarding the effective reproductive number Re, our analysis suggests that until mid October, Re was above 2.3 in both countries; from mid October to December 21, Re dropped well below unity in Liberia, indicating a saturation of the epidemic, while in Sierra Leone it was around 1.9, indicating an ongoing epidemic. Accordingly, a ten-week projection from December 21 estimated that the epidemic will fade out in Liberia in early March; in contrast, our results flashed a note of caution for Sierra Leone since the cumulative number of cases could reach as high as 18,000, and the number of deaths might exceed 5,000, by early March 2015. However, by processing the reported data of the very last period (December 21, 2014-January 18, 2015), we obtained more optimistic estimates indicative of a remission of the epidemic in Sierra Leone, as reflected by the derived Re (~0.82, 95% CI: 0.81-0.83).",2015,Mar 9,PLoS Curr,7,,,26064785,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.8d5984114855fc425e699e1a18cdc6c9,,#886,Siettos 2015,"",""
Distinguishing epidemiological features of the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak,"Shultz, J.

This briefing presents a series of distinguishing epidemiological features that set this outbreak apart. Compared to one concurrent and 23 previous outbreaks of the disease over 40 years, this was the only occurrence of Ebola virus disease involving multiple nations and qualifying as a pandemic. Across multiple measures of magnitude, the 2013-2016 outbreak was accurately described using superlatives: largest and deadliest in terms of numbers of cases and fatalities; longest in duration; and most widely dispersed geographically, with outbreak-associated cases occurring in 10 nations. In contrast, the case-fatality rate was much lower for the 2013-2016 outbreak compared to the other 24 outbreaks. A population of particular interest for ongoing monitoring and public health surveillance is comprised of more than 17,000 ""survivors,"" Ebola patients who successfully recovered from their illness. The daunting challenges posed by this outbreak were met by an intensive international public health response.

Modeling the effect of comprehensive interventions on Ebola virus transmission,"Shen, M.; Xiao, Y.; Rong, L.","Since the re-emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014, comprehensive and stringent interventions have been implemented to decelerate the spread of the disease. The effectiveness of interventions still remains unclear. In this paper, we develop an epidemiological model that includes various controlling measures to systematically evaluate their effects on the disease transmission dynamics. By fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia until March 22, 2015, we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. Model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation, below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more Ebola infection. This challenges an existing view. Media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size. The response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries. Among all the interventions, we find that shortening the duration between death and burial and improving the effectiveness of isolation are two effective interventions for controlling the outbreak of Ebola virus infection.",2015,Oct 30,Sci Rep,5,,15818,26515898,10.1038/srep15818,,#944,Shen 2015,"",""

The high morbidity and mortality have inspired response strategies to the outbreak at the individual, regional, and national levels. Methods to provide real-time assessment of changing transmission dynamics are critical to the understanding of how these adaptive intervention measures have affected the spread of the outbreak. Methods In this analysis, we use the time series of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia up to September 8, 2014, and employ novel methodology to estimate how the rate of exponential rise of new cases has changed over the outbreak using piecewise fits of exponential curves to the outbreak data. Results We find that for Liberia and Guinea, the effective reproduction number rose, rather than fell, around the time that the outbreak spread to densely populated cities, and enforced quarantine was imposed on several regions in the countries; this may indicate that enforced quarantine may not be an effective control measure.

We aimed to determine the occurrence of previously undocumented Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and infections, and to reconstruct transmission events. METHODS: This cross-sectional seroprevalence survey of the adult population of Meliandou used a highly specific oral fluid test and detailed interviews of all households in the village and key informants. Each household was interviewed, with all members prompted to describe the events of the outbreak, any illness within the household, and possible contact with suspected cases. Information for deceased individuals was provided by relatives living in the same household. Symptoms were based on Ebola virus Makona variant EVD case definitions (focusing on fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea). For antibody testing, we used an Ebola virus glycoprotein IgG capture enzyme immunoassay developed from a previously validated assay. A maximum exposure level was assigned to every participant using a predetermined scale. We used a generalised linear model (logit function) to estimate odds ratios for the association of sociodemographic variables and exposure level with Ebola virus infection. We adjusted estimates for age and maximum exposure, as appropriate. FINDINGS: Between June 22, and July 9, 2017, we enrolled 237 participants from 27 households in Meliandou. Two households refused to participate and one was absent. All adults in participating households who were present for the interview provided an oral fluid swab for testing, of which 224 were suitable for analysis. In addition to the 11 EVD deaths described previously, on the basis of clinical description and oral fluid testing, we found two probable EVD deaths and eight previously unrecognised anti-Ebola virus IgG-positive survivors, including one who had mild symptoms and one who was asymptomatic, resulting in a case fatality of 55.6% (95% CI 30.8-78.5) for adults. Health-care work (adjusted odds ratio 6.64, 1.54-28.56; p=0.001) and level of exposure (odds ratio adjusted for linear trend across five levels 2.79, 1.59-4.883; p<0.0001) were independent risk factors for infection. INTERPRETATION: Ebola virus infection was more widespread in this spillover population than previously recognised (21 vs 11 cases). We show the first serological evidence of survivors in this population (eight anti-Ebola virus IgG seropositive) and report a case fatality lower than previously reported (55.6% vs 100% in adults). These data show the high community coverage achievable by using a non-invasive test and, by accurately documenting the beginnings of the west African Ebola virus outbreak, reveal important insight into transmission dynamics and risk factors that underpin Ebola virus spillover events.

D.; Kagume Njenge, H.; Johnson, G.; Nugba Ballah, R.; James, D.; Wone, A.; Bedford, J.; McClelland, A.","BACKGROUND: Safely burying Ebola infected individuals is acknowledged to be important for controlling Ebola epidemics and was a major component of the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola response. Yet, in order to understand the impact of safe burial programs it is necessary to elucidate the role of unsafe burials in sustaining chains of Ebola transmission and how the risk posed by activities surrounding unsafe burials, including care provided at home prior to death, vary with human behavior and geography. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Interviews with next of kin and community members were carried out for unsafe burials in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, in six districts where the Red Cross was responsible for safe and dignified burials (SDB). Districts were randomly selected from a district-specific sampling frame comprised of villages and neighborhoods that had experienced cases of Ebola. An average of 2.58 secondary cases were potentially generated per unsafe burial and varied by district (range: 0-20). Contact before and after death was reported for 142 (46%) contacts. Caregivers of a primary case were 2.63 to 5.92 times more likely to become EVD infected compared to those with post-mortem contact only. Using these estimates, the Red Cross SDB program potentially averted between 1,411 and 10,452 secondary EVD cases, reducing the epidemic by 4.9% to 36.5%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SDB is a fundamental control measure that limits community transmission of Ebola; however, for those individuals having contact before and after death, it was impossible to ascertain the exposure that caused their infection.

Notably, we propose an activity driven network approach to contact tracing, and estimate the basic reproductive ratio of the epidemic growth in different scenarios.

Case fatality in the west African Ebola virus disease epidemic has been highest in children younger than 5 years. Clinical data on outcomes can provide important evidence to guide future management. However, such data on children are scarce and disaggregated clinical data across all ages in this epidemic have focussed on symptoms reported on arrival at treatment facilities, rather than symptoms and signs observed during admission. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of children aged 5 years and younger admitted to the MSF EMCs in Bo and Kailahun, and any associations between these characteristics and mortality. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we included data from children aged 5 years and younger with laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease admitted to EMCs between June and December, 2014. We described epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics and viral load (measured using Ebola virus cycle thresholds [Ct]), and assessed their association with death using Cox regression modelling. FINDINGS: We included 91 children in analysis; 52 died (57.1%). Case fatality was higher in children aged less than 2 years (76.5% [26/34]) than those aged 2-5 years (45.6% [26/57]; adjusted HR 3.5 [95% CI 1.5-8.5]) and in those with high (Ct<25) versus low (Ct>/=25) viral load (81.8% [18/22] vs 45.9% [28/61], respectively; adjusted HR 9.2 [95% CI 3.8-22.5]). Symptoms observed during admission included: weakness 74.7% (68); fever 70.8% (63/89); distress 63.7% (58); loss of appetite 60.4% (55); diarrhoea 59.3% (54); and cough 52.7% (48).

F.","BACKGROUND: Limited clinical and laboratory data are available on patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD). The Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which had an existing infrastructure for research regarding viral hemorrhagic fever, has received and cared for patients with EVD since the beginning of the outbreak in Sierra Leone in May 2014. METHODS: We reviewed available epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory records of patients in whom EVD was diagnosed between May 25 and June 18, 2014. We used quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays to assess the load of Ebola virus (EBOV, Zaire species) in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: Of 106 patients in whom EVD was diagnosed, 87 had a known outcome, and 44 had detailed clinical information available. The incubation period was estimated to be 6 to 12 days, and the case fatality rate was 74%. Common findings at presentation included fever (in 89% of the patients), headache (in 80%), weakness (in 66%), dizziness (in 60%), diarrhea (in 51%), abdominal pain (in 40%), and vomiting (in 34%). Clinical and laboratory factors at presentation that were associated with a fatal outcome included fever, weakness, dizziness, diarrhea, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine. Exploratory analyses indicated that patients under the age of 21 years had a lower case fatality rate than those over the age of 45 years (57% vs. 94%, P=0.03), and patients presenting with fewer than 100,000 EBOV copies per milliliter had a lower case fatality rate than those with 10 million EBOV copies per milliliter or more (33% vs. 94%, P=0.003). Bleeding occurred in only 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: The incubation period and case fatality rate among patients with EVD in Sierra Leone are similar to those observed elsewhere in the 2014 outbreak and in previous outbreaks. Although bleeding was an infrequent finding, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal manifestations were common.

We summarized the clinical characteristics of patients with EVD and analyzed the factors related to their death. METHODS: Patients admitted for care at the Freetown China-Sierra Leone Friendship Hospital during 1 October-14 November 2014 were enrolled in this study. The clinical data of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were confirmed to have EVD; 28 of them (45.9%) were male and 33 (54.1%) were female. Their median age was 28 years (range, 1.17-67 years). The median duration from symptom onset to clinic visit time was 5 days (range, 1-16 days). Among these patients, 42 of them (68.9%) died.

Assessing the effects of modeling the spectrum of clinical symptoms on the dynamics and control of Ebola,"Ponce, J.; Zheng, Y.; Lin, G.; Feng, Z.","Mathematical modelers have attempted to capture the dynamics of Ebola transmission and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures, as well as to make predictions about ongoing outbreaks. Many of their models consider only infections with typical symptoms, but Ebola presents clinically in a more complicated way. Even the most common symptom, fever, is not experienced by 13% of patients. This suggests that infected individuals could be asymptomatic or have moderately symptomatic infections as reported during previous Ebola outbreaks. To account crudely for the spectrum of clinical symptoms that characterizes Ebola infection, we developed a model including moderate and severe symptoms. Our model captures the dynamics of the recent outbreak of Ebola in Liberia. Our estimate of the basic reproduction number is 1.83 (CI: 1.72, 1.86), consistent with the WHO response team's estimate using early outbreak case data. We also estimate the effectiveness of interventions using observations before and after their introduction. As the final epidemic size is linked to the timing of interventions in an exponential fashion, a simple empirical formula is provided to guide policy-making. It suggests that early implementation could significantly decrease final size. We also compare our model to one with typical symptoms by excluding moderate ones. The model with only typical symptoms overestimates the basic reproduction number and effectiveness of control measures, and exaggerates changes in peak size attributable to the timing of interventions. In addition, uncertainty about how moderate symptoms affect the basic reproduction number is considered, and PRCC (Partial rank correlation coefficient) is used to analyze the global sensitivity of relevant parameters. Possible control strategies are evaluated through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis, indicating that simultaneously strengthening contact-tracing and effectiveness of isolation in hospital would be most effective.

Can Ebola virus evolve to be less virulent in humans?,"Sofonea, M. T.; Aldakak, L.; Boullosa, Lfvv; Alizon, S.","Understanding Ebola virus (EBOV) virulence evolution not only is timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio on the scale of an outbreak and in the long term. Our major finding is that the virus's specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOV's high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.",2018,Mar,J Evol Biol,31,3,382-392,29288541,10.1111/jeb.13229,,#1323,Sofonea 2018,Sangeeta Bhatia (2019-10-21 23:08:59)(Select): transmission modelling.; ,""
Forecasting Epidemics Through Nonparametric Estimation of Time-Dependent Transmission Rates Using the SEIR Model,"Smirnova, A.; deCamp, L.; Chowell, G.","Deterministic and stochastic methods relying on early case incidence data for forecasting epidemic outbreaks have received increasing attention during the last few years. In mathematical terms, epidemic forecasting is an ill-posed problem due to instability of parameter identification and limited available data. While previous studies have largely estimated the time-dependent transmission rate by assuming specific functional forms (e.g., exponential decay) that depend on a few parameters, here we introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of nonparametric time-dependent transmission rates by projecting onto a finite subspace spanned by Legendre polynomials. This approach enables us to effectively forecast future incidence cases, the clear advantage over recovering the transmission rate at finitely many grid points within the interval where the data are currently available. In our approach, we compare three regularization algorithms: variational (Tikhonov's) regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), and modified TSVD in order to determine the stabilizing strategy that is most effective in terms of reliability of forecasting from limited data.

Contextual behaviours associated with increased risk of exposure included travel to high-transmission settings, caring for sick and preparing the deceased for traditional funerals. Although such behaviours are widespread in West Africa, high-transmission pockets were observed. Superspreading and clustering are typical phenomena in infectious disease outbreaks, as a relatively small number of transmission chains are often responsible for the majority of events. Determining the characteristics of contacts at greatest risk of developing disease and of cases with greatest transmission potential could therefore help curb propagation of infection. Our analysis of contact tracing data from Montserrado County, Liberia, suggested that the probability of transmission was 4.5 times higher for individuals who were reported as having contact with multiple cases. The probability of individuals developing disease was not significantly associated with age or sex of their source case but was higher when they were in the same household as the infectious case. Surveillance efforts for rapidly identifying symptomatic individuals and effectively messaged campaigns encouraging household members to bring the sick to designated treatment centres without administration of home care could mitigate transmission.This article is part of the themed issue 'The 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic: data, decision-making and disease control'.",2017,May 26,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,372,1721,,28396472,10.1098/rstb.2016.0301,,#1375,Skrip 2017,"",""

However, there is concern about persistence of Ebola virus in the reproductive tract of men who have survived EVD. We aimed to use biostatistical modelling to describe the dynamics of Ebola virus RNA load in seminal fluid, including clearance parameters. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we recruited men who had been discharged from three Ebola treatment units in Guinea between January and July, 2015. Participants provided samples of seminal fluid at follow-up every 3-6 weeks, which we tested for Ebola virus RNA using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Representative specimens from eight participants were then inoculated into immunodeficient mice to test for infectivity. We used a linear mixed-effect model to analyse the dynamics of virus persistence in seminal fluid over time. FINDINGS: We enrolled 26 participants and tested 130 seminal fluid specimens; median follow up was 197 days (IQR 187-209 days) after enrolment, which corresponded to 255 days (228-287) after disease onset. Ebola virus RNA was detected in 86 semen specimens from 19 (73%) participants. Median duration of Ebola virus RNA detection was 158 days after onset (73-181; maximum 407 days at end of follow-up). Mathematical modelling of the quantitative time-series data showed a mean clearance rate of Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid of -0.58 log units per month, although the clearance kinetic varied greatly between participants. Using our biostatistical model, we predict that 50% and 90% of male survivors clear Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid at 115 days (90% prediction interval 72-160) and 294 days (212-399) after disease onset, respectively. We also predicted that the number of men positive for Ebola virus RNA in affected countries would decrease from about 50 in January 2016, to fewer than 1 person by July, 2016. Infectious virus was detected in 15 of 26 (58%) specimens tested in mice. INTERPRETATION: Time to clearance of Ebola virus RNA from seminal fluid varies greatly between individuals and could be more than 13 months.

As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277 reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10,899 deaths. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Gueckedou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea. The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. In March 2014, when the first cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion.

It is possible that high environmental temperatures may exacerbate volume depletion or interfere with the provision of medical care by providers in full personal protective equipment. We investigated the effect of environmental temperature on case fatality. METHODS: The International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in Liberia and Sierra Leone during the 2014-2016 epidemic. Demographic and outcomes variables for 465 patients with EVD were sourced from a de-identified, quality-checked clinical database collected by IMC. Daily environmental temperature data for Liberia and Sierra Leone were collected from a publicly available database (Weather Underground). Mean daily environmental temperatures were averaged across each patient's ETU stay and environmental temperature thresholds were determined. Multiple logistic regression was utilised, with forward variable selection and threshold for entry of P < 0.1. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. The following variables were analysed as potential confounders: age, sex, ETU, length of ETU operation and date of treatment. RESULTS: Case fatality was 57.6% among patients diagnosed with EVD. Analysis of case fatality across environmental temperature quintiles indicated a threshold effect; the optimal threshold for average environmental temperature during a patient's ETU stay was determined empirically to be 27.4 degrees C (81.3 degrees F). Case fatality was significantly greater for patients with average environmental temperatures above the threshold (70.4%) vs. below (52.0%) (P < 0.001). In multiple regression, patients with average environmental temperature above the threshold during their ETU stay were significantly more likely to die than patients below the threshold (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.6-3.8, P < 0.001). This trend was observed only among patients treated in white tent ETUs, and not in ETUs with aluminium roofs. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that an average environmental temperature above 27.4 degrees C (81.3 degrees F) during patients' ETU stay is associated with greater risk of death among patients with EVD. Further studies should investigate this effect. These results have potential implications for reducing case fatality through improved ETU construction or other temperature control methods within ETUs during future outbreaks.",2019,Jan,Trop Med Int Health,24,1,23-30,30307686,10.1111/tmi.13166,,#1483,Peters 2019,Anne Cori (2019-10-28 22:41:01)(Select): CFR; ,""
Using phenomenological models for forecasting the 2015 Ebola challenge,"Pell, B.; Kuang, Y.; Viboud, C.; Chowell, G.","BACKGROUND: The rising number of novel pathogens threatening the human population has motivated the application of mathematical modeling for forecasting the trajectory and size of epidemics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We summarize the real-time forecasting results of the logistic equation during the 2015 Ebola challenge focused on predicting synthetic data derived from a detailed individual-based model of Ebola transmission dynamics and control. We also carry out a post-challenge comparison of two simple phenomenological models. In particular, we systematically compare the logistic growth model and a recently introduced generalized Richards model (GRM) that captures a range of early epidemic growth profiles ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model for estimating the reproduction number, generate short-term forecasts of the epidemic trajectory, and predict the final epidemic size. RESULTS: During the challenge the logistic equation consistently underestimated the final epidemic size, peak timing and the number of cases at peak timing with an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.49, 0.36 and 0.40, respectively. Post-challenge, the GRM which has the flexibility to reproduce a range of epidemic growth profiles ranging from early sub-exponential to exponential growth dynamics outperformed the logistic growth model in ascertaining the final epidemic size as more incidence data was made available, while the logistic model underestimated the final epidemic even with an increasing amount of data of the evolving epidemic. Incidence forecasts provided by the generalized Richards model performed better across all scenarios and time points than the logistic growth model with mean RMS decreasing from 78.00 (logistic) to 60.80 (GRM). Both models provided reasonable predictions of the effective reproduction number, but the GRM slightly outperformed the logistic growth model with a MAPE of 0.08 compared to 0.10, averaged across all scenarios and time points.

The animal population in which the disease agent is able to reproduce in sufficient number to be able to transmit to a susceptible human host is called a reservoir. There is little work devoted to understanding stochastic population dynamics in the presence of a reservoir, specifically the phenomena of disease extinction and reintroduction. Here, we build a stochastic EVD model and explicitly consider the impacts of an animal reservoir on the disease persistence. Our modelling approach enables the analysis of invasion and fade-out dynamics, including the efficacy of possible intervention strategies.

Our model's results show that there exists a threshold parameter, R 0, with the property that when its value is above unity, an endemic equilibrium exists whose value and size are determined by the size of this threshold parameter, and when its value is less than unity, the infection does not spread into the community. The equilibrium state, when it exists, is locally and asymptotically stable with oscillatory returns to the equilibrium point. The basic reproduction number, R 0, is shown to be strongly dependent on the initial response of the emergency services to suspected cases of Ebola infection.

Subsequent outbreaks then appeared in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The study of environmental factors underlying EVD epidemiology may provide useful insights into when and where EVD outbreaks are more likely to occur. In this paper, we aimed to investigate the association between climatic factors and onset of EVD outbreaks in humans. Our results suggest lower temperature and higher absolute humidity are associated with EVD outbreak onset in the previous EVD outbreaks in Africa during 1976 to 2014. Potential mechanisms through which climate may have an influence on ebolavirus infection in the natural host, intermediate hosts and humans are discussed. Current and future surveillance efforts should be supported to further understand ebolavirus transmission events between and within species.",2014,Sep 4,Euro Surveill,19,35,,25210981,,,#1561,Ng 2014,Sangeeta Bhatia (2019-10-23 02:14:40)(Select): included for table 1.; Ruth McCabe (2019-10-18 21:39:13)(Select): only provides OR for prob of outbreak; no other quantities reported; ,""

Inferring epidemiological parameters from phylogenies using regression-ABC: A comparative study,"Saulnier, E.; Gascuel, O.; Alizon, S.","Inferring epidemiological parameters such as the R0 from time-scaled phylogenies is a timely challenge. Most current approaches rely on likelihood functions, which raise specific issues that range from computing these functions to finding their maxima numerically. Here, we present a new regression-based Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach, which we base on a large variety of summary statistics intended to capture the information contained in the phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot. The regression step involves the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, which is a robust machine learning technique. It allows us to readily deal with the large number of summary statistics, while avoiding resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To compare our approach to existing ones, we simulated target trees under a variety of epidemiological models and settings, and inferred parameters of interest using the same priors. We found that, for large phylogenies, the accuracy of our regression-ABC is comparable to that of likelihood-based approaches involving birth-death processes implemented in BEAST2. Our approach even outperformed these when inferring the host population size with a Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemiological model. It also clearly outperformed a recent kernel-ABC approach when assuming a Susceptible-Infected epidemiological model with two host types. Lastly, by re-analyzing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we showed that regression-ABC provides more realistic estimates for the duration parameters (latency and infectiousness) than the likelihood-based method. Overall, ABC based on a large variety of summary statistics and a regression method able to perform variable selection and avoid overfitting is a promising approach to analyze large phylogenies.",2017,Mar,PLoS Comput Biol,13,3,e1005416,28263987,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005416,,#1636,Saulnier 2017,Juliette Unwin (2019-05-02 02:19:28)(Screen): Mentions inferring RO; ,""
Modeling the impact of interventions on an epidemic of ebola in sierra leone and liberia,"Rivers, C. M.; Lofgren, E. T.; Marathe, M.; Eubank, S.; Lewis, B. L.","BACKGROUND: An Ebola outbreak of unparalleled size is currently affecting several countries in West Africa, and international efforts to control the outbreak are underway. However, the efficacy of these interventions, and their likely impact on an Ebola epidemic of this size, is unknown. Forecasting and simulation of these interventions may inform public health efforts. METHODS: We use existing data from Liberia and Sierra Leone to parameterize a mathematical model of Ebola and use this model to forecast the progression of the epidemic, as well as the efficacy of several interventions, including increased contact tracing, improved infection control practices, the use of a hypothetical pharmaceutical intervention to improve survival in hospitalized patients. FINDINGS: Model forecasts until Dec. 31, 2014 show an increasingly severe epidemic with no sign of having reached a peak. Modeling results suggest that increased contact tracing, improved infection control, or a combination of the two can have a substantial impact on the number of Ebola cases, but these interventions are not sufficient to halt the progress of the epidemic. The hypothetical pharmaceutical intervention, while impacting mortality, had a smaller effect on the forecasted trajectory of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Near-term, practical interventions to address the ongoing Ebola epidemic may have a beneficial impact on public health, but they will not result in the immediate halting, or even obvious slowing of the epidemic. A long-term commitment of resources and support will be necessary to address the outbreak.",2014,Nov 6,PLoS Curr,6,,,25685630,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.4d41fe5d6c05e9df30ddce33c66d084c,,#1653,Rivers 2014,"",""

During the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects. In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in quarantined contacts of reported Ebola virus disease cases in a recognized 'hotspot.' METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from October 2015 to January 2016. A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants, 132 negative controls (individuals with a low likelihood of previous exposure to Ebola virus), and 30 positive controls (Ebola virus disease survivors). IgG responses to Ebola glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were measured using Alpha Diagnostic International ELISA kits with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader. A cutoff of 4.7 U/mL for the anti-GP ELISA yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing positive and negative controls. We identified 14 seropositive individuals not known to have had Ebola virus disease. Two of the 14 seropositive individuals reported only fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a 'hotspot' village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection.",2016,Nov,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,11,e0005087,27846221,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005087,,#1686,Richardson 2016,"",serosurvey in humans

Cases and contacts were interviewed, contacts followed prospectively through the 21-day incubation period, and secondary cases confirmed by laboratory testing. Results: We enrolled 150 index Ebola cases and 838 contacts; 83 (9.9%) contacts developed Ebola during 21-day follow-up. In multivariable analysis, risk factors for transmission included index case death in the household, Ebola symptoms but no reported fever, age <20 years, more days with wet symptoms; and providing care to the index case (P < .01 for each). Protective factors included avoiding the index case after illness onset and a piped household drinking water source (P < .01 for each). Conclusions: To reduce Ebola transmission, communities should rapidly identify and follow-up all household contacts; isolate those with Ebola symptoms, including those without reported fever; and consider closer monitoring of contacts who provided care to cases.

For the first time, an out break of an unusual illness-Ebola haemorrhagic fever occurred in Northern Uganda Gulu district. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiologic and clinical aspects of hospitalised children and adolescents on the isolation wards. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive survey of hospital records for hospitalised children and adolescents under 18 years on the isolation wards in Gulu, Northern Uganda was conducted. All patient test notes were consecutively reviewed and non was excluded because being deficient. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that 90 out of the 218 national laboratory confirmed Ebola cases were children and adolescents with a case fatality of 40%.

"The Transmission Chain Analysis of 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Koinadugu District, Sierra Leone: An Observational Study","Muoghalu, I. S.; Moses, F.; Conteh, I.; Swaray, P.; Ajudua, A.; Nordstrom, A.","INTRODUCTION: Sierra Leone experienced an unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in all its districts. Koinadugu District was the last to report an EVD case. Several outbreak response strategies were implemented. As part of lessons learnt, we conducted an observational study to describe the transmission chain in the district and the impact of the control measures implemented to contain the outbreak. METHODS: We reconstructed the transmission chain, positioning both confirmed and probable cases, described the distribution of the EVD confirmed cases in the context of the routes of transmission (Community, Funeral or Health facility setting) and assessed the impact of control measures using the surveillance data collected during the outbreak. RESULTS: All 142 confirmed and probable EVD cases registered were fully resolved in the transmission chain. 72.5% of all the EVD cases in the district were exposed in the community, 26.1% exposed during funerals, and 1.4% exposed in the health facility setting. Health-care workers contributed little to the EVD outbreak. 71.1% of EVD transmission occurred among family members. Female EVD cases generated more secondary cases than their male counterparts (P = 0.03). With removal of EVD cases from the community and admission to the community care center (CCC), the EVD transmission in the community decreased to substantially lower rates. In addition, transmission due to exposure in health facilities was further reduced with the implementation of full infection and prevention controls. CONCLUSION: This study details the transmission chain of EVD in a rural district setting and the public health interventions implemented to successfully limit the outbreak to just one of 11 chiefdoms. Heightened community-based surveillance for early case detection, swift isolation of suspect cases, efficient contact tracing and monitoring, and good infection prevention and control measures in health facilities were highly effective in limiting transmission and, eventually, breaking the transmission chain. CCCs were also instrumental in achieving early isolation and basic care for suspect cases, while ensuring that their family members who were close contacts remained in the community for easy contact tracing and monitoring. These were very useful lessons learnt that would inform the management of future outbreaks.",2017,,Front Public Health,5,,160,28740846,10.3389/fpubh.2017.00160,,#1891,Muoghalu 2017,"",""

To assess the degree of asymptomatic infection occurring during an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, we carried out a serological survey in the Djera district of the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo affected by an Ebola outbreak in 2014. We sampled all asymptomatic residents (n = 182) of 48 households where at least one case of EVD was detected. To control for potential background seroprevalence of Ebola antibodies in the population, we also sampled 188 individuals from 92 households in an unaffected area with a similar demographic background. We tested the sera collected for anti-Ebola IgG and IgM antibodies at four different dilutions. We then developed a mixture model to estimate the likely number of asymptomatic patients who developed IgM and IgG responses to Ebola antigens in both groups. While we detected an association between medium to high titres and age, we did not detect any evidence of increased asymptomatic infection in the individuals who resided in the same household as cases.This article is part of the themed issue 'The 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic: data, decision-making and disease control'.",2017,May 26,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,372,1721,,28396474,10.1098/rstb.2016.0303,,#2045,Mbala 2017,"",""
Spatiotemporal Evolution of Ebola Virus Disease at Sub-National Level during the 2014 West Africa Epidemic: Model Scrutiny and Data Meagreness,"Santermans, E.; Robesyn, E.; Ganyani, T.; Sudre, B.; Faes, C.; Quinten, C.; Van Bortel, W.; Haber, T.; Kovac, T.; Van Reeth, F.; Testa, M.; Hens, N.; Plachouras, D.","BACKGROUND: The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected at least 27,443 individuals and killed 11,207, based on data until 24 June, 2015, released by the World Health Organization (WHO). This outbreak has been characterised by extensive geographic spread across the affected countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and by localized hotspots within these countries. The rapid recognition and quantitative assessment of localised areas of higher transmission can inform the optimal deployment of public health resources. METHODS: A variety of mathematical models have been used to estimate the evolution of this epidemic, and some have pointed out the importance of the spatial heterogeneity apparent from incidence maps. However, little is known about the district-level transmission. Given that many response decisions are taken at sub-national level, the current study aimed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity by using a different modelling framework, built on publicly available data at district level. Furthermore, we assessed whether this model could quantify the effect of intervention measures and provide predictions at a local level to guide public health action. We used a two-stage modelling approach: a) a flexible spatiotemporal growth model across all affected districts and b) a deterministic SEIR compartmental model per district whenever deemed appropriate. FINDINGS: Our estimates show substantial differences in the evolution of the outbreak in the various regions of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, illustrating the importance of monitoring the outbreak at district level. We also provide an estimate of the time-dependent district-specific effective reproduction number, as a quantitative measure to compare transmission between different districts and give input for informed decisions on control measures and resource allocation. Prediction and assessing the impact of control measures proved to be difficult without more accurate data. In conclusion, this study provides us a useful tool at district level for public health, and illustrates the importance of collecting and sharing data.",2016,,PLoS One,11,1,e0147172,26771513,10.1371/journal.pone.0147172,,#2065,Santermans 2016,"",""

Reduced Risk of Importing Ebola Virus Disease because of Travel Restrictions in 2014: A Retrospective Epidemiological Modeling Study,"Otsuki, S.; Nishiura, H.","BACKGROUND: An epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) from 2013-16 posed a serious risk of global spread during its early growth phase. A post-epidemic evaluation of the effectiveness of travel restrictions has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in reducing the risk of importation from mid-August to September, 2014, using a simple hazard-based statistical model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The hazard rate was modeled as an inverse function of the effective distance, an excellent predictor of disease spread, which was calculated from the airline transportation network. By analyzing datasets of the date of EVD case importation from the 15th of July to the 15th of September 2014, and assuming that the network structure changed from the 8th of August 2014 because of travel restrictions, parameters that characterized the hazard rate were estimated. The absolute risk reduction and relative risk reductions due to travel restrictions were estimated to be less than 1% and about 20%, respectively, for all models tested. Effectiveness estimates among African countries were greater than those for other countries outside Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The travel restrictions were not effective enough to expect the prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease. It is more efficient to control the spread of disease locally during an early phase of an epidemic than to attempt to control the epidemic at international borders. Capacity building for local containment and coordinated and expedited international cooperation are essential to reduce the risk of global transmission.",2016,,PLoS One,11,9,e0163418,27657544,10.1371/journal.pone.0163418,,#2160,Otsuki 2016,"",""
An outbreak of Ebola in Uganda,"Okware, S. I.; Omaswa, F. G.; Zaramba, S.; Opio, A.; Lutwama, J. J.; Kamugisha, J.; Rwaguma, E. B.; Kagwa, P.; Lamunu, M.","An outbreak of Ebola disease was reported from Gulu district, Uganda, on 8 October 2000. The outbreak was characterized by fever and haemorrhagic manifestations, and affected health workers and the general population of Rwot-Obillo, a village 14 km north of Gulu town. Later, the outbreak spread to other parts of the country including Mbarara and Masindi districts. Response measures included surveillance, community mobilization, case and logistics management. Three coordination committees were formed: National Task Force (NTF), a District Task Force (DTF) and an Interministerial Task Force (IMTF). The NTF and DTF were responsible for coordination and follow-up of implementation of activities at the national and district levels, respectively, while the IMTF provided political direction and handled sensitive issues related to stigma, trade, tourism and international relations. The international response was coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) under the umbrella organization of the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network. A WHO/CDC case definition for Ebola was adapted and used to capture four categories of cases, namely, the 'alert', 'suspected', 'probable' and 'confirmed cases'. Guidelines for identification and management of cases were developed and disseminated to all persons responsible for surveillance, case management, contact tracing and Information Education Communication (IEC). For the duration of the epidemic that lasted up to 16 January 2001, a total of 425 cases with 224 deaths were reported countrywide. The case fatality rate was 53%. The attack rate (AR) was highest in women. The average AR for Gulu district was 12.6 cases/10 000 inhabitants when the contacts of all cases were considered and was 4.5 cases/10 000 if limited only to contacts of laboratory confirmed cases. The secondary AR was 2.5% when nearly 5000 contacts were followed up for 21 days. Uganda was finally declared Ebola free on 27 February 2001, 42 days after the last case was reported. The Government's role in coordination of both local and international support was vital. The NTF and the corresponding district committees harmonized implementation of a mutually agreed programme. Community mobilization using community-based resource persons and political organs, such as Members of Parliament was effective in getting information to the public. This was critical in controlling the epidemic. Past experience in epidemic management has shown that in the absence of regular provision of information to the public, there are bound to be deleterious rumours. Consequently rumour was managed by frank and open discussion of the epidemic, providing daily updates, fact sheets and press releases. Information was regularly disseminated to communities through mass media and press conferences. Thus all levels of the community spontaneously demonstrated solidarity and response to public health interventions.

I.; Omaswa, F.; Talisuna, A.; Amandua, J.; Amone, J.; Onek, P.; Opio, A.; Wamala, J.; Lubwama, J.; Luswa, L.; Kagwa, P.; Tylleskar, T.","BACKGROUND: Five outbreaks of ebola occurred in Uganda between 2000-2012. The outbreaks were quickly contained in rural areas. However, the Gulu outbreak in 2000 was the largest and complex due to insurgency. It invaded Gulu municipality and the slum- like camps of the internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Bundigugyo district outbreak followed but was detected late as a new virus. The subsequent outbreaks in the districts of Luwero district (2011, 2012) and Kibaale (2012) were limited to rural areas. METHODS: Detailed records of the outbreak presentation, cases, and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. Each outbreak was described and the outcomes examined for the different scenarios. RESULTS: Early detection and action provided the best outcomes and results. The ideal scenario occurred in the Luwero outbreak during which only a single case was observed. Rural outbreaks were easier to contain. The community imposed quarantine prevented the spread of ebola following introduction into Masindi district. The outbreak was confined to the extended family of the index case and only one case developed in the general population. However, the outbreak invasion of the town slum areas escalated the spread of infection in Gulu municipality. Community mobilization and leadership was vital in supporting early case detection and isolations well as contact tracing and public education. CONCLUSION: Palliative care improved survival.

METHODS: First-, second-, and third-generation contacts were traced, monitored, and classified. Symptomatic contacts were managed at Ebola treatment centers as suspected, probable, and confirmed EVD cases using standard operating procedures adapted from the World Health Organization EVD guidelines. Reverse transcription PCR tests confirmed EVD. Socio-demographic, clinical, hospitalization, and outcome data of the July-September 2014 Nigeria EVD cohort were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the 20 EVD cases was 33 years (interquartile range 26-62 years). More females (55%), health workers (65%), and persons <40 years old (60%) were infected than males, non-health workers, and persons aged >/=40 years. No EVD case management worker contracted the disease. Presenting symptoms were fever (85%), fatigue (70%), and diarrhea (65%). Clinical syndromes were gastroenteritis (45%), hemorrhage (30%), and encephalopathy (15%). The case-fatality rate was 40% and there was one mental health complication. The average duration from symptom onset to presentation was 3+/-2 days among survivors and 5+/-2 days for non-survivors. The mean duration from symptom onset to discharge was 15+/-5 days for survivors and 11+/-2 days for non-survivors. Mortality was higher in the older age group, males, and those presenting late. CONCLUSION: The EVD outbreak in Nigeria was characterized by the severe febrile gastroenteritis syndrome typical of the West African outbreak, better outcomes, rapid containment, and no infection among EVD care-providers.

Lassa virus, the cause of Lassa fever, a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans is endemic in West Africa. In Sierra Leone at the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory, up to 70 % of acute patient samples suspected of Lassa fever test negative for Lassa virus infection.

Our objective was to create a predictive score for EVD. We retrospectively reviewed all suspected cases admitted to the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Nzerekore, Guinea, between December 2, 2014, and February 23, 2015. We used a multivariate logistic regression model to identify clinical and epidemiological factors associated with EVD, which were used to create a predictive score.

F.","BACKGROUND: The Ebola virus disease spread rapidly in West Africa in 2014, leading to the loss of thousands of lives. Community engagement was one of the key strategies to interrupt Ebola transmission, and practical community level measures needed to be explored in the field and tailored to the specific context of communities. METHODS: First, community-level education on Ebola virus disease (EVD) prevention was launched for the community's social mobilizers in six districts in Sierra Leone beginning in November 2014. Then, from January to May of 2015, in three pilot communities, local trained community members were organized to engage in implementation of EVD prevention and transmission interruption measures, by involving them in alert case report, contact tracing, and social mobilization. The epidemiological indicators of transmission interruption in three study communities were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 6 016 community social mobilizers from 185 wards were trained by holding 279 workshops in the six districts, and EVD message reached an estimated 631 680 residents. In three pilot communities, 72 EVD alert cases were reported, with 70.8 % of them detected by trained local community members, and 14 EVD cases were finally identified. Contact tracing detected 64.3 % of EVD cases. The median duration of community infectivity for the cases was 1 day. The secondary attack rate was 4.2 %, and no third generation of infection was triggered. No health worker was infected, and no unsafe burial and noncompliance to EVD control measures were recorded. The community-based measures were modeled to reduce 77 EVD cases, and the EVD-free goal was achieved four months earlier in study communities than whole country of Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: The community-based strategy of social mobilization and community engagement was effective in case detection and reducing the extent of Ebola transmission in a country with weak health system. The successfully practical experience to reduce the risk of Ebola transmission in the community with poor resources would potentially be helpful for the global community to fight against the EVD and the other diseases in the future.",2016,Aug 5,Infect Dis Poverty,5,1,74,27491387,10.1186/s40249-016-0167-0,,#2546,Li 2016,"",""

M.; Cundy, S.; Levine, A. C.","BACKGROUND: The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest ever recorded. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) managed 5 Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which cumulatively cared for about 2,500 patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patient data collected at the 5 ETUs over 1 year of operations. METHODS: To collect clinical and epidemiological data from the patient care areas, each chart was either manually copied across the fence between the high-risk zone and low-risk zone, imaged across the fence, or imaged in the high-risk zone. Each ETU's data were entered into a separate electronic database, and these were later combined into a single relational database. Lot quality assurance sampling was used to ensure data quality, with reentry of data with high error rates from imaged records. RESULTS: The IMC database contains records on 2,768 patient presentations, including 2,351 patient admissions with full follow-up data. Of the patients admitted, 470 (20.0%) tested positive for EVD, with an overall case fatality ratio (CFR) of 57.0% for EVD-positive patients and 8.1% for EVD-negative patients. Although more men were admitted than women (53.4% vs. 46.6%), a larger proportion of women were diagnosed EVD positive (25.6% vs. 15.2%). Diarrhea, red eyes, contact with an ill person, and funeral attendance were significantly more common in patients with EVD than in those with other diagnoses. Among EVD-positive patients, age was a significant predictor of mortality: the highest CFRs were among children under 5 (89.1%) and adults over 55 (71.4%). DISCUSSION: While several prior reports have documented the experiences of individual ETUs, this study is the first to present data from multiple ETUs across 2 countries run by the same organization with similar clinical protocols.

A network model for Ebola spreading,"Rizzo, A.; Pedalino, B.; Porfiri, M.","The availability of accurate models for the spreading of infectious diseases has opened a new era in management and containment of epidemics. Models are extensively used to plan for and execute vaccination campaigns, to evaluate the risk of international spreadings and the feasibility of travel bans, and to inform prophylaxis campaigns. Even when no specific therapeutical protocol is available, as for the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), models of epidemic spreading can provide useful insight to steer interventions in the field and to forecast the trend of the epidemic. Here, we propose a novel mathematical model to describe EVD spreading based on activity driven networks (ADNs). Our approach overcomes the simplifying assumption of homogeneous mixing, which is central to most of the mathematically tractable models of EVD spreading. In our ADN-based model, each individual is not bound to contact every other, and its network of contacts varies in time as a function of an activity potential. Our model contemplates the possibility of non-ideal and time-varying intervention policies, which are critical to accurately describe EVD spreading in afflicted countries. The model is calibrated from field data of the 2014 April-to-December spreading in Liberia. We use the model as a predictive tool, to emulate the dynamics of EVD in Liberia and offer a one-year projection, until December 2015. Our predictions agree with the current vision expressed by professionals in the field, who consider EVD in Liberia at its final stage. The model is also used to perform a what-if analysis to assess the efficacy of timely intervention policies. In particular, we show that an earlier application of the same intervention policy would have greatly reduced the number of EVD cases, the duration of the outbreak, and the infrastructures needed for the implementation of the intervention.",2016,Apr 7,J Theor Biol,394,,212-222,26804645,10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.01.015,,#2653,Rizzo 2016,"",""

We find that ring vaccination can successfully contain an outbreak for values of the effective reproduction number up to 1.6. Through an extensive sensitivity analysis of parameters characterising the readiness and capacity of the health care system, we identify interventions that, alongside ring vaccination, could increase the likelihood of containment. In particular, shortening the time from symptoms onset to hospitalisation to 2-3 days on average through improved contact tracing procedures, adding a 2km spatial component to the vaccination ring, and decreasing human mobility by quarantining affected areas might contribute increase our ability to contain outbreaks with effective reproduction number up to 2.6.

We developed a model of Ebola virus transmission that integrates detailed geographical and demographic data from Liberia to overcome the limitations of non-spatial approaches in projecting the disease dynamics and assessing non-pharmaceutical control interventions. METHODS: We modelled the movements of individuals, including patients not infected with Ebola virus, seeking assistance in health-care facilities, the movements of individuals taking care of patients infected with Ebola virus not admitted to hospital, and the attendance of funerals. Individuals were grouped into randomly assigned households (size based on Demographic Health Survey data) that were geographically placed to match population density estimates on a grid of 3157 cells covering the country. The spatial agent-based model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The model was used to estimate Ebola virus transmission parameters and investigate the effectiveness of interventions such as availability of Ebola treatment units, safe burials procedures, and household protection kits. FINDINGS: Up to Aug 16, 2014, we estimated that 38.3% of infections (95% CI 17.4-76.4) were acquired in hospitals, 30.7% (14.1-46.4) in households, and 8.6% (3.2-11.8) while participating in funerals. We noted that the movement and mixing, in hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic, of patients infected with Ebola virus and those not infected was a sufficient driver of the reported pattern of spatial spread. The subsequent decrease of incidence at country and county level is attributable to the increasing availability of Ebola treatment units (which in turn contributed to drastically decreased hospital transmission), safe burials, and distribution of household protection kits. INTERPRETATION: The model allows assessment of intervention options and the understanding of their role in the decrease in incidence reported since Sept 7, 2014.

L.; Bawo, L.; Nyenswah, T. G.; Galvani, A. P.","BACKGROUND: A substantial scale-up in public health response is needed to control the unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in west Africa. Current international commitments seek to expand intervention capacity in three areas: new EVD treatment centres, case ascertainment through contact tracing, and household protective kit allocation. We aimed to assess how these interventions could be applied individually and in combination to avert future EVD cases and deaths. METHODS: We developed a transmission model of Ebola virus that we fitted to reported EVD cases and deaths in Montserrado County, Liberia. We used this model to assess the effectiveness of expanding EVD treatment centres, increasing case ascertainment, and allocating protective kits for controlling the outbreak in Montserrado. We varied the efficacy of protective kits from 10% to 50%. We compared intervention initiation on Oct 15, 2014, Oct 31, 2014, and Nov 15, 2014. The status quo intervention was defined in terms of case ascertainment and capacity of EVD treatment centres on Sept 23, 2014, and all behaviour and contact patterns relevant to transmission as they were occurring at that time. The primary outcome measure was the expected number of cases averted by Dec 15, 2014. FINDINGS: We estimated the basic reproductive number for EVD in Montserrado to be 2.49 (95% CI 2.38-2.60). We expect that allocating 4800 additional beds at EVD treatment centres and increasing case ascertainment five-fold in November, 2014, can avert 77 312 (95% CI 68 400-85 870) cases of EVD relative to the status quo by Dec 15, 2014. Complementing these measures with protective kit allocation raises the expectation as high as 97 940 (90 096-105 606) EVD cases. If deployed by Oct 15, 2014, equivalent interventions would have been expected to avert 137 432 (129 736-145 874) cases of EVD. If delayed to Nov 15, 2014, we expect the interventions will at best avert 53 957 (46 963-60 490) EVD cases. INTERPRETATION: The number of beds at EVD treatment centres needed to effectively control EVD in Montserrado substantially exceeds the 1700 pledged by the USA to west Africa. Accelerated case ascertainment is needed to maximise effectiveness of expanding the capacity of EVD treatment centres. Distributing protective kits can further augment prevention of EVD, but it is not an adequate stand-alone measure for controlling the outbreak.

Targeted education through practical health information to particular groups and sub-populations is crucial to controlling the disease. In this paper, we study the dynamics of Ebola virus disease in the presence of public health education with the aim of assessing the role of behavior change induced by health education to the dynamics of an outbreak. The power of behavior change is evident in two outbreaks of EVD that took place in Sudan only 3 years apart. The first occurrence was the first documented outbreak of EVD and produced a significant number of infections. The second outbreak produced far fewer cases, presumably because the population in the region learned from the first outbreak. We derive a system of ordinary differential equations to model these two contrasting behaviors. Since the population in Sudan learned from the first outbreak of EVD and changed their behavior prior to the second outbreak, we use data from these two instances of EVD to estimate parameters relevant to two contrasting behaviors. We then simulate a future outbreak of EVD in Sudan using our model that contains two susceptible populations, one being more informed about EVD. Our finding show how a more educated population results in fewer cases of EVD and highlights the importance of ongoing public health education.",2017,Aug,Infect Dis Model,2,3,323-340,29928745,10.1016/j.idm.2017.06.004,,#2890,Levy 2017,"",""
Derivation and Internal Validation of the Ebola Prediction Score for Risk Stratification of Patients With Suspected Ebola Virus Disease,"Levine, A. C.; Shetty, P. P.; Burbach, R.; Cheemalapati, S.; Glavis-Bloom, J.; Wiskel, T.; Kesselly, J. K.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: The current outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa is the largest on record and has overwhelmed the capacity of local health systems and the international community to provide sufficient isolation and treatment of all suspected cases. The goal of this study is to develop a clinical prediction model that can help clinicians risk-stratify patients with suspected Ebola virus disease in the context of such an epidemic. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of patient data collected during routine clinical care at the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit in Liberia during its first 16 weeks of operation. The predictive power of 14 clinical and epidemiologic variables was measured against the primary outcome of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease, using logistic regression to develop a final prediction model. Bootstrap sampling was used to assess the internal validity of the model and estimate its performance in a simulated validation cohort. RESULTS: Ebola virus disease testing results were available for 382 (97%) of 395 patients admitted to the Ebola treatment unit during the study period. A total of 160 patients (42%) tested positive for Ebola virus disease. Logistic regression analysis identified 6 variables independently predictive of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease, including sick contact, diarrhea, loss of appetite, muscle pains, difficulty swallowing, and absence of abdominal pain. The Ebola Prediction Score, constructed with these 6 variables, had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.80) for the prediction of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease. Patients with higher Ebola Prediction Scores had higher likelihoods of laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease. CONCLUSION: The Ebola Prediction Score can be used by clinicians as an adjunct to current Ebola virus disease case definitions to risk-stratify patients with suspected Ebola virus disease. Clinicians can use this new tool for the purpose of cohorting patients within the suspected-disease ward of an Ebola treatment unit or community-based isolation center to prevent nosocomial infection or as a triage tool when patient numbers overwhelm available capacity. Given the inherent limitations of clinical prediction models, however, a low-cost, point-of-care test that can rapidly and definitively exclude Ebola virus disease in patients should be a research priority.",2015,Sep,Ann Emerg Med,66,3,285-293.e1,25845607,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2015.03.011,,#2896,Levine 2015,"",""

The incidence time series exhibit many low integers as well as zero counts requiring an intrinsically stochastic modeling approach. In order to capture the stochastic nature of the transitions between the compartmental populations in such a model we specify appropriate conditional binomial distributions. In addition, a relatively simple temporally varying transmission rate function is introduced that allows for the effect of control interventions. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference that are used to explore the posterior distribution of the parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over state variables of the model, which are unobserved.

However, official numbers may have underestimated the size of the outbreak. Closure of health facilities and mistrust in existing structures may have additionally impacted on all-cause morbidity and mortality. To quantify mortality and morbidity and describe health-seeking behaviour in Monrovia, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) conducted a mobile phone survey from December 2014 to March 2015. We drew a random sample of households in Monrovia and conducted structured mobile phone interviews, covering morbidity, mortality and health-seeking behaviour from 14 May 2014 until the day of the survey. We defined an Ebola-related death as any death meeting the Liberian Ebola case definition. We calculated all-cause and Ebola-specific mortality rates. The sample consisted of 6,813 household members in 905 households. We estimated a crude mortality rate (CMR) of 0.33/10,000 persons/day (95%CI:0.25-0.43) and an Ebola-specific mortality rate of 0.06/10,000 persons/day (95%-CI:0.03-0.11). During the recall period, 17 Ebola cases were reported including those who died. In the 30 days prior to the survey 277 household members were reported sick; malaria accounted for 54% (150/277). Of the sick household members, 43% (122/276) did not visit any health care facility. The mobile phone-based survey was found to be a feasible and acceptable alternative method when data collection in the community is impossible. CMR was estimated well below the emergency threshold of 1/10,000 persons/day. Non-Ebola-related mortality in Monrovia was not higher than previous national estimates of mortality for Liberia. However, excess mortality directly resulting from Ebola did occur in the population. Importantly, the small proportion of sick household members presenting to official health facilities when sick might pose a challenge for future outbreak detection and mitigation. Substantial reported health-seeking behaviour outside of health facilities may also suggest the need for adapted health messaging and improved access to health care.",2016,Aug,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,8,e0004899,27551750,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004899,,#3052,Kuehne 2016,"",""

We developed a mathematical model of EVD transmission, and measured how transmission changed over time in the 12 districts of Sierra Leone with sustained transmission between June 2014 and February 2015. We used the model to estimate how many cases were averted as a result of the introduction of additional treatment beds in each area.

R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size, but estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated directly from incidence data.

It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r.

M.","BACKGROUND: The seventh reported outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the equatorial African country of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) began on July 26, 2014, as another large EVD epidemic continued to spread in West Africa. Simultaneous reports of EVD in equatorial and West Africa raised the question of whether the two outbreaks were linked. METHODS: We obtained data from patients in the DRC, using the standard World Health Organization clinical-investigation form for viral hemorrhagic fevers. Patients were classified as having suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD or a non-EVD illness. Blood samples were obtained for polymerase-chain-reaction-based diagnosis, viral isolation, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The outbreak began in Inkanamongo village in the vicinity of Boende town in Equateur province and has been confined to that province. A total of 69 suspected, probable, or confirmed cases were reported between July 26 and October 7, 2014, including 8 cases among health care workers, with 49 deaths. As of October 7, there have been approximately six generations of cases of EVD since the outbreak began. The reported weekly case incidence peaked in the weeks of August 17 and 24 and has since fallen sharply. Genome sequencing revealed Ebola virus (EBOV, Zaire species) as the cause of this outbreak. A coding-complete genome sequence of EBOV that was isolated during this outbreak showed 99.2% identity with the most closely related variant from the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit in the DRC and 96.8% identity to EBOV variants that are currently circulating in West Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The current EVD outbreak in the DRC has clinical and epidemiologic characteristics that are similar to those of previous EVD outbreaks in equatorial Africa. The causal agent is a local EBOV variant, and this outbreak has a zoonotic origin different from that in the 2014 epidemic in West Africa.

Effect of sexual transmission on the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014: a mathematical modelling study,"Luo, D.; Zheng, R.; Wang, D.; Zhang, X.; Yin, Y.; Wang, K.; Wang, W.","The outbreak of the Ebola virus has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the affected areas, and Ebola virus RNA has been found in the semen of the survivors after 9 months of symptom onset. However, the role that sexual transmission played in the transmission is not very clear. In this paper, we developed a compartmental model for Ebola virus disease (EVD) dynamics, which includes three different infectious routes: contact with the infectious, contact with dead bodies, and transmission by sexual behaviour with convalescent survivors. We fitted the model to daily cumulative cases from the first reported infected case to October 25, 2014 for the epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The basic reproduction numbers in these countries were estimated as 1.6726 (95%CI:1.5922-1.7573), 1.8162 (95%CI:1.7660-1.8329) and 1.4873 (95%CI:1.4770-1.4990), respectively.

A three-scale network model for the early growth dynamics of 2014 west Africa ebola epidemic,"Kiskowski, M. A.","BACKGROUND: In mid-October 2014, the number of cases of the West Africa Ebola virus epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia exceeded 9,000 cases. The early growth dynamics of the epidemic has been qualitatively different for each of the three countries. However, it is important to understand these disparate dynamics as trends of a single epidemic spread over regions with similar geographic and cultural aspects, with likely common parameters for transmission rates and reproduction number R0. METHODS: We combine a discrete, stochastic SEIR model with a three-scale community network model to demonstrate that the different regional trends may be explained by different community mixing rates. Heuristically, the effect of different community mixing rates may be understood as the observation that two individuals infected by the same chain of transmission are more likely to share the same contacts in a less-mixed community. Local saturation effects occur as the contacts of an infected individual are more likely to already be exposed by the same chain of transmission. RESULTS: The effects of community mixing, together with stochastic effects, can explain the qualitative difference in the growth of Ebola virus cases in each country, and why the probability of large outbreaks may have recently increased. An increase in the rate of Ebola cases in Guinea in late August, and a local fitting of the transient dynamics of the Ebola cases in Liberia, suggests that the epidemic in Liberia has been more severe, and the epidemic in Guinea is worsening, due to discrete seeding events as the epidemic spreads into new communities. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively simple network model provides insight on the role of local effects such as saturation that would be difficult to otherwise quantify. Our results predict that exponential growth of an epidemic is driven by the exposure of new communities, underscoring the importance of limiting this spread.",2014,Nov 13,PLoS Curr,6,,,25685614,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.c6efe8274dc55274f05cbcb62bbe6070,,#3342,Kiskowski 2014,"",""
"Modeling household and community transmission of Ebola virus disease: Epidemic growth, spatial dynamics and insights for epidemic control","Kiskowski, M.; Chowell, G.","The mechanisms behind the sub-exponential growth dynamics of the West Africa Ebola virus disease epidemic could be related to improved control of the epidemic and the result of reduced disease transmission in spatially constrained contact structures. An individual-based, stochastic network model is used to model immediate and delayed epidemic control in the context of social contact networks and investigate the extent to which the relative role of these factors may be determined during an outbreak. We find that in general, epidemics quickly establish a dynamic equilibrium of infections in the form of a wave of fixed size and speed traveling through the contact network. Both greater epidemic control and limited community mixing decrease the size of an infectious wave. However, for a fixed wave size, epidemic control (in contrast with limited community mixing) results in lower community saturation and a wave that moves more quickly through the contact network. We also found that the level of epidemic control has a disproportionately greater reductive effect on larger waves, so that a small wave requires nearly as much epidemic control as a larger wave to end an epidemic.",2016,,Virulence,7,2,163-73,26399855,10.1080/21505594.2015.1076613,,#3343,Kiskowski 2016,"",""

Most of the previous studies done in Sierra Leone relating to the clinical and epidemiological features of EVD during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak focused on adult EVD patients. There have been conflicting reports about the effects of EVD on children during previous outbreaks. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective analysis of medical data of all laboratory confirmed paediatric EVD patients below 15 years of age who were admitted at the 34 Military Hospital Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Wilberforce, Sierra Leone between June 2014 to April 2015. We analyzed the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric EVD cases contained in case report forms that were collected by Ebola surveillance officers and clinicians at the 34 Military Hospital ETC. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric EVD patients that were associated with EVD facility-based mortality. RESULTS: The majority of the paediatric EVD cases in this study were female (56.1%), pupils (51.1%), and 43.2% belonged to the age group between 10 years and below 15 years.

These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging.",2017,Oct,PLoS Comput Biol,13,10,e1005798,29084216,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005798,,#3470,Lau 2017,"",""

Models have focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that represent the average number of secondary infections produced by a random infectious individual. However, these population-level estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading events. Although superspreading features prominently in first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems) cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated by each infected individual. Our results show that superspreaders play a key role in sustaining onward transmission of the epidemic, and they are responsible for a significant proportion ([Formula: see text]61%) of the infections. Our results also suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We also show that community-based cases may have progressed more rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance (with median value of 2.51 km).

The factors that determine patient survival are poorly understood; however, clinical observations indicate that EBOV viremia may be associated with fatal outcome. We conducted a study of the kinetics of Zaire EBOV viremia in patients with EBOV disease (EVD) who were managed at an Ebola Treatment Centre in Sierra Leone during the recent West African outbreak. METHODS: Data from 84 EVD patients (38 survivors, 46 nonsurvivors) were analyzed, and EBOV viremia was quantified between 2 and 13 days after symptom onset. Time since symptom onset and clinical outcome were used as independent variables to compare EBOV viral kinetics in survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: In all patients, EBOV viremia kinetics was a quadratic function of time; however, EBOV viremia was 0.94 logarithm (log) copies per ml (cp/ml) (P = 0.011) higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors from day 2 after the onset of symptoms. Survivors reached peak viremia levels at an earlier time after symptom onset than nonsurvivors (day 5 versus day 7) and had lower mean peak viremia levels compared with nonsurvivors (7.46 log cp/ml; 95% CI, 7.17-7.76 vs. 8.60 log cp/ml; 95% CI, 8.27-8.93). Before reaching peak values, EBOV viremia similarly increased both in survivors and nonsurvivors; however, the decay of viremia after the peak was much stronger in survivors than in nonsurvivors. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that plasma concentrations of EBOV are markedly different between survivors and nonsurvivors at very early time points after symptom onset and may be predicative of outcome.

At the onset of the epidemic, there was little information about the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and risk factors in urban settings as previous outbreaks were limited to rural/semi-rural settings. This study, therefore, aimed to describe the epidemiology of the outbreak and the factors which had most impact on the transmission of the epidemic and whether there were different drivers from those previously described in rural settings. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive epidemiology study in WA, Sierra Leone using secondary data from the National Ebola outbreak database. We also reviewed the Ebola situation reports, response strategy documents, and other useful documents. RESULTS: A total of 4,955 Ebola cases were identified between June 2014 and November 2015, although there were reports of cases occurring in WA toward end of May. All wards were affected, and Waterloo Area I (Ward 330), the capital city of Western Area Rural District, recorded the highest numbers of cases (580) and deaths (236). Majority of cases (63.4%) and deaths (66.8%) were in WA Urban District (WAU); 44 cases were imported from other provinces. Only 20% of cases had a history of contact with an Ebola case, and more than 30% were death alerts. Equal numbers of males and females were infected, and very few cases (3.2%) were health workers. Overall, transmission was through contact with infected individuals, and intense transmission occurred at the community level. In WAU, transmission was mostly between neighbors and among inhabitants of shared accommodations. The drivers of transmission included high population movement to and from WA, overcrowding, fear and lack of trust in the response, and negative community behaviors. Transmission was mostly through contact and with limited transmission through sex and breast milk. CONCLUSION: The unprecedented outbreak in WA was attributed to delayed detection, inadequate preparedness and response, intense population movements, overcrowding, and unresponsive communities.

Both countries share borders with Uganda. A total of 425 cases and 224 deaths attributed to Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) were recorded in Uganda in 2000/01. Although there was delayed detection at the community level, prompt and efficient outbreak investigation led to the confirmation of the causative agent on 14 October 2000 by the National Institute of Virology in South Africa, and the subsequent institution of control interventions. CONTROL INTERVENTIONS: Public health interventions to contain the epidemic aimed at minimizing transmission in the health care setting and in the community, reducing the case fatality rate due to the epidemic, strengthening co-ordination for the response and building capacity for on-going surveillance and control. Co-ordination of the control interventions was organized through the Interministerial Committee, National Ebola Task Force, District Ebola Task Forces, and the Technical Committees at national and district levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) under the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network co-ordinated the international response. The post-outbreak control interventions addressed weaknesses prior to outbreak detection and aimed at improving preparations for future outbreak detection and response. Challenges to control efforts included inadequate and poor quality protective materials, deaths of health workers, numerous rumors and the rejection of convalescent cases by members of the community. CONCLUSIONS: This was recognized as the largest reported outbreak of EHF in the world. Control interventions were very successful in containing the epidemic. The community structures used to contain the epidemic have continued to perform well after containment of the outbreak, and have proved useful in the identification of other outbreaks.

High blood viral load (>/=10(6) copies/ml) was found to be predictive of the non-survival outcome as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The probability of patients' survival was less than 15 % when blood viral load was greater than 10(6) copies/ml. Multivariate analyses showed that blood viral load (P = 0.005), confusion (P = 0.010), abdominal pain (P = 0.003), conjunctivitis (P = 0.035), and vomiting (P = 0.004) were factors independently associated with the outcomes of EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most death occurred within 1 week after admission, and patients at the age of 6 or younger had a lower survival rate. Most surviving patients turned blood EBOV negative within 1-4 weeks after admission.

The combined dataset was utilized to produce phylogenetic and phylodynamic inferences, to study sink(-)source dynamics and virus dispersal from highly-populated transmission hotspots. We identified four districts in SLE where EBOV was introduced and transmission occurred without onward exportation to other districts. We also identified six districts that substantially contributed to the dispersal of the virus and prolonged the EVD outbreak: five of these served as major hubs, with lots of movement in and out, and one acted primarily as a source, exporting the virus to other areas of the country. Positive correlations between case numbers, inter-district transition events, and district population sizes reaffirm that population size was a driver of EBOV transmission dynamics in SLE. The data presented here confirm the role of urban hubs in virus dispersal and of a delayed laboratory response in the expansion and perpetuation of the EVD outbreak in SLE.",2019,Jan 16,Viruses,11,1,,30654482,10.3390/v11010071,,#3569,JansenvanVuren 2019,"",""
The large graph limit of a stochastic epidemic model on a dynamic multilayer network,"Jacobsen, K. A.; Burch, M. G.; Tien, J. H.; Rempala, G. A.","We consider a Markovian SIR-type (Susceptible --> Infected --> Recovered) stochastic epidemic process with multiple modes of transmission on a contact network. The network is given by a random graph following a multilayer configuration model where edges in different layers correspond to potentially infectious contacts of different types. We assume that the graph structure evolves in response to the epidemic via activation or deactivation of edges of infectious nodes. We derive a large graph limit theorem that gives a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the evolution of quantities of interest, such as the proportions of infected and susceptible vertices, as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Analysis of the limiting system elucidates how the coupling of edge activation and deactivation to infection status affects disease dynamics, as illustrated by a two-layer network example with edge types corresponding to community and healthcare contacts. Our theorem extends some earlier results describing the deterministic limit of stochastic SIR processes on static, single-layer configuration model graphs. We also describe precisely the conditions for equivalence between our limiting ODEs and the systems obtained via pair approximation, which are widely used in the epidemiological and ecological literature to approximate disease dynamics on networks.

We aimed to characterize symptoms and outcomes among pregnant women admitted to Ebola treatment units (ETUs) with suspected and confirmed EVD to better inform obstetric management. Methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of reproductive-aged women presenting to 5 West African ETUs from September 2014 to September 2015. We compared clinical symptoms, risk of EVD diagnosis, and mortality between pregnant and nonpregnant women. Results: Of 729 reproductive-aged women admitted to study ETUs, 44 (6%) reported pregnancy. Thirteen of 44 pregnant women (30%) tested EVD positive; 6 of 13 (46%) died. Pregnant women were less likely than nonpregnant women to report anorexia, asthenia, diarrhea, fever, myalgias/arthralgias, nausea, or vomiting (P < .05) at admission. Pregnant women with suspected EVD had the same risk, however, of laboratory-confirmed EVD (30% vs 24%, P = .38). While pregnant women with confirmed EVD had similar Ebola viral loads on presentation to nonpregnant women, as measured by initial cycle threshold (26.4 vs 23.2, P = .16), they were less likely to have myalgias/arthralgias (P< .001) and vomiting (P = .02).

"Assessing the direct effects of the ebola outbreak on life expectancy in liberia, sierra leone and Guinea","Helleringer, S.; Noymer, A.","BACKGROUND: An EVD outbreak may reduce life expectancy directly (due to high mortality among EVD cases) and indirectly (e.g., due to lower utilization of healthcare and subsequent increases in non-EVD mortality). In this paper, we investigated the direct effects of EVD on life expectancy in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (LSLG thereafter). METHODS: We used data on EVD cases and deaths published in situation reports by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as data on the age of EVD cases reported from patient datasets. We used data on non-EVD mortality from the most recent life tables published prior to the EVD outbreak. We then formulated three scenarios based on hypotheses about a) the extent of under-reporting of EVD cases and b) the EVD case fatality ratio. For each scenario, we re-estimated the number of EVD deaths in LSLG and we applied standard life table techniques to calculate life expectancy. RESULTS: In Liberia, possible reductions in life expectancy resulting from EVD deaths ranged from 1.63 year (low EVD scenario) to 5.56 years (high EVD scenario), whereas in Sierra Leone, possible life expectancy declines ranged from 1.38 to 5.10 years. In Guinea, the direct effects of EVD on life expectancy were more limited (<1.20 year). CONCLUSIONS: Our high EVD scenario suggests that, due to EVD deaths, life expectancy may have declined in Liberia and Sierra Leone to levels these two countries had not experienced since 2001-2003, i.e., approximately the end of their civil wars. The total effects of EVD on life expectancy may however be larger due to possible concomitant increases in non-EVD mortality during the outbreak.",2015,Feb 19,PLoS Curr,7,,,25737805,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.01a99f8342b42a58d806d7d1749574ea,,#3681,Helleringer 2015,Sangeeta Bhatia (2019-10-17 00:59:38)(Select): Not focused on transmission or epidemiological characteristics.; ,""

Ahmad M.; Imran, M.","BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease has reemerged as a major public health crisis in Africa, with isolated cases also observed globally, during the current outbreak. METHODS: To estimate the basic reproductive ratio R0, which is a measure of the severity of the outbreak, we developed a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) type deterministic model, and used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Two different data sets are available: one with raw reported data and one with corrected data (as the CDC suspects under-reporting). RESULTS: Using a deterministic ordinary differential equation transmission model for Ebola epidemic, the basic reproductive ratio R0 for Liberia resulted to be 1.757 and 1.9 for corrected and uncorrected case data, respectively. For Sierra Leone, R0 resulted to be 1.492 and 1.362 for corrected and uncorrected case data, respectively. In each of the two cases we considered, the estimate for the basic reproductive ratio was initially greater than unity leading to an epidemic outbreak. CONCLUSION: We obtained robust estimates for the value of R0 associated with the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and showed that there is close agreement between our estimates of R0. Analysis of our model also showed that effective isolation is required, with the contact rate in isolation less than one quarter of that for the infected non-isolated population, and that the fraction of high-risk individuals must be brought to less than 10% of the overall susceptible population, in order to bring the value of R0 to less than 1, and hence control the outbreak.",2015,,Infect Dis Poverty,4,,13,25737782,10.1186/s40249-015-0043-3,,#3777,Khan 2015,"",""
An empirical analysis of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa,"Khaleque, A.; Sen, P.","The data for the Ebola outbreak that occurred in 2014-2016 in three countries of West Africa are analysed within a common framework.

The cumulative (total) density of infected population here has the form , where the parameters depend on delta and the infection probability q. This form is seen to fit well with the data. Using the best fitting parameters, the time at which the peak is reached is estimated and is shown to be consistent with the data. We also show that in the Euclidean model, one can choose delta and q values which reproduce the data for the three countries qualitatively. These choices are correlated with population density, control schemes and other factors. Comparing the real data and the results from the model one can also estimate the size of the actual population susceptible to the disease.

We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment).

We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score.

With increasingly sensitive EVD diagnosis, there is a need for more accurate prognostic tools that objectively stratify clinical severity to better allocate limited resources and identify those most in need of intensive treatment. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This retrospective cohort study analyses the clinical characteristics of 158 EVD(+) patients at the GOAL-Mathaska Ebola Treatment Centre, Sierra Leone. The prognostic potential of each characteristic was assessed and incorporated into a statistically weighted disease score. The mortality rate among EVD(+) patients was 60.8% and highest in those aged <5 or >25 years (p<0.05). Death was significantly associated with malaria co-infection (OR = 2.5, p = 0.01). However, this observation was abrogated after adjustment to Ebola viral load (p = 0.1), potentially indicating a pathologic synergy between the infections. Similarly, referral-time interacted with viral load, and adjustment revealed referral-time as a significant determinant of mortality, thus quantifying the benefits of early reporting as a 12% mortality risk reduction per day (p = 0.012). Disorientation was the strongest unadjusted predictor of death (OR = 13.1, p = 0.014) followed by hiccups, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, dyspnoea and myalgia.

Evaluating large-scale blood transfusion therapy for the current Ebola epidemic in Liberia,"Gutfraind, A.; Meyers, L.

However, the feasibility and likely impacts of broad implementation of transfusions are yet unknown. METHODS: We extended an Ebola virus transmission model published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to include hospital-based convalescent donations and transfusions. Using recent epidemiological estimates for EVD in Liberia and assuming that convalescent transfusions reduce the case-fatality rate to 12.5% (range, 7.5%-17.5%), we projected the impacts of a countrywide ramp-up of transfusion therapy. RESULTS: Under the 10% case-hospitalization rate estimated for Liberia in September 2014, large-scale CP therapy is expected to save 3586 lives by October 2015 (3.1% mortality reduction; 95% confidence interval [CI], .52%-4.5%). Under a higher 30% hospitalization rate, CP transfusions are expected to save 151 lives (0.9% of the total; 95% CI, .21%-11%).

Identifying spatio-temporal dynamics of Ebola in Sierra Leone using virus genomes,"Gustafson, K. B.; Proctor, J.

In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the EBOV epidemic in Sierra Leone that uses individual virus genome sequences to inform population-level, spatial models. Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages of virus genomes, these spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV in Sierra Leone without the need for human mobility data. Consistent with other investigations, our results show that the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the epidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our phylodynamic analysis also revealed a change in model preference towards a spatial model with power-law characteristics in the latter portion of the epidemic, correlated with the timing of major intervention campaigns.

Filovirus antibody reacting sera were found in all zones investigated, and in all populations studied (Ebola virus IgG 5.3%; Marburg virus IgG 2.4%). Pygmies appeared to have a significantly higher seroprevalence (P < 0.03) against Ebola-Zaire virus (7.02%) than non-Pygmies (4.2%). MBG virus or related unknown filovirus strains also seem to be present in the western part of Central Africa. MBG virus antibodies were present in different Pygmy groups (ranging from 0.7 to 5.6%, mean 2.05%) and in several non-Pygmy populations (ranging from 0.0 to 3.9%, mean 3.4%) without an overall significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.14).

Be-CoDiS: A Mathematical Model to Predict the Risk of Human Diseases Spread Between Countries--Validation and Application to the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic,"Ivorra, B.; Ngom, D.; Ramos, A. M.","Ebola virus disease is a lethal human and primate disease that currently requires a particular attention from the international health authorities due to important outbreaks in some Western African countries and isolated cases in the UK, the USA and Spain. Regarding the emergency of this situation, there is a need for the development of decision tools, such as mathematical models, to assist the authorities to focus their efforts in important factors to eradicate Ebola. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic spatial-temporal model, called Between-Countries Disease Spread (Be-CoDiS), to study the evolution of human diseases within and between countries. The main interesting characteristics of Be-CoDiS are the consideration of the movement of people between countries, the control measure effects and the use of time-dependent coefficients adapted to each country. First, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model and explain how its parameters and inputs are obtained. Then, in order to validate our approach, we consider two numerical experiments regarding the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic. The first one studies the ability of the model in predicting the EVD evolution between countries starting from the index cases in Guinea in December 2013. The second one consists of forecasting the evolution of the epidemic by using some recent data. The results obtained with Be-CoDiS are compared to real data and other model outputs found in the literature. Finally, a brief parameter sensitivity analysis is done.

I.; Decroo, T.; Balde, I.; Nordenstedt, H.; van Griensven, J.; De Weggheleire, A.","Non-cases are suspect Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases testing negative by EVD RT-PCR after admission to an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). Admitting non-cases to an ETC prompts concerns on case- and workload in the ETC, risk for nosocomial EVD infection, and delays in diagnosis and disease-specific treatment. We retrospectively analysed characteristics, outcomes and determinants of death of EVD cases and non-cases admitted to the Conakry ETC in Guinea between 03/2014 and 09/2015. Of the 2362 admitted suspects who underwent full confirmatory PCR testing, 1540 (65.2%) were non-cases; among them 727 needed repeated confirmatory PCR testing resulting in 2.5 days (average) in the ETC isolation ward. Twenty-one patients tested positive on the repeat test, most in a period of flawed sampling for the initial test and none after introduction of PCR confirmation with geneXpert. No readmissions following nosocomial EVD infection were recorded. No combination of symptoms yielded acceptable sensitivity and specificity to allow differentiating confirmed from non-cases. Symptoms as ocular bleeding/redness have high specificity, but limited usefulness as not common. Admission delay and age distribution were not different for both groups. In total, 98 (20.6%) of 475 deaths in the ETC were non-cases. Most died within 24 hours after admission. Living in Conakry (aOR 1.78 (1.08-2.96)) was the strongest risk factor for death. Weeks with higher admission load had lower case fatality among non-cases, probably because more acute (and treatable) illnesses of contacts of known cases were admitted. These findings show high numbers of potentially critically ill non-cases need to be considered when setting up triage and referral of EVD suspect cases. Symptoms and risk factors alone do not allow differentiating the non-cases. Integration of highly-sensitive EVD diagnostic methods with short turnaround time in the triage of peripheral hospitals and dropping the systematic 2nd PCR for symptomatic early presenters could limit delays in access to adapted care of cases and seriously ill non-cases.

Routine laboratory analytics are often unavailable in the outbreak setting, and few data exist for the associated haematological and biochemical abnormalities. We aimed to assess laboratory and clinical data from patients with Ebola virus disease to better inform clinical management algorithms, improve understanding of key variables associated with outcome, and provide insight into the pathophysiology of Ebola virus disease. METHODS: We recruited all patients, alive on arrival, with confirmed Ebola virus disease who were admitted to the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone. At admission, all patients had clinical presentation recorded and blood taken for Ebola confirmation using reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and for haematological and biochemical analysis. We studied the association between these and clinical outcome. The primary outcome was discharge from the Ebola treatment centre. FINDINGS: 150 patients were admitted to the treatment centre between Dec 8, 2014, and Jan 9, 2015. The mean age of patients was 26 years (SD 14.7). Case fatality rate was 37% (55/150).

Acute kidney injury was common (52/104 [50%]), as were abnormal serum potassium (32/97 [33%]), severe hepatitis (54/92 [59%]), and raised C-reactive protein (21/100 [21%]). Haematological abnormalities were common, including raised haematocrit (15/100 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (47/104 [45%]), and granulocytosis (44/104 [42%]). Severe acute kidney injury, low RT-PCR cycle threshold (<20 cycles), and severe hepatitis were independently associated with mortality.

Temporal Course of 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) Outbreak in West Africa Elucidated through Morbidity and Mortality Data: A Tale of Three Countries,"Hsieh, Y. H.","The explosive outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in 2014 appeared to have lessened in 2015, but potentially continues be a global public health threat. A simple mathematical model, the Richards model, is utilized to gauge the temporal variability in the spread of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa in terms of its reproduction number R and its temporal changes via detection of epidemic waves and turning points during the 2014 outbreaks in the three most severely affected countries; namely, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The results reveal multiple waves of infection in each of these three countries, of varying lengths from a little more than one week to more than one month. All three countries exhibit marginally fluctuating reproduction numbers during June-October before gradually declining. Although high mobility continues between neighboring populations of these countries across the borders, outbreak in these three countries exhibits decidedly different temporal patterns. Guinea had the most waves but maintained consistently low transmissibility and hence has the smallest number of reported cases. Liberia had highest level of transmission before October, but has remained low since, with no detectable wave after the New Year. Sierra Leone has gradually declining waves since October, but still generated detectable waves up to mid-March 2015, and hence has cumulated the largest number of cases-exceeding that of Guinea and Liberia combined. Analysis indicates that, despite massive amount of international relief and intervention efforts, the outbreak is persisting in these regions in waves, albeit more sparsely and at a much lower level since the beginning of 2015.",2015,,PLoS One,10,11,e0140810,26559945,10.1371/journal.pone.0140810,,#4155,Hsieh 2015,"",""

R.; Dicks, S.; Baguelin, M.; Moore, D. A. J.; Mabey, D.; Roberts, C. H.; Kumar, A.; Samuel, D.; Tedder, R.; Glynn, J. R.","BACKGROUND: Healthcare and other front-line workers are at particular risk of infection with Ebola virus (EBOV). Despite the large-scale deployment of international responders, few cases of Ebola virus disease have been diagnosed in this group. Since asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection has been described, it is plausible that infections have occurred in healthcare workers but have escaped being diagnosed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection, and of exposure events, among returned responders to the West African Ebola epidemic 2014-2016. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used snowball sampling to identify responders who had returned to the UK or Ireland, and used an online consent and questionnaire to determine their exposure to EBOV and their experience of illness. Oral fluid collection devices were sent and returned by post, and samples were tested using an EBOV IgG capture assay that detects IgG to Ebola glycoprotein. Blood was collected from returnees with reactive samples for further testing. Unexposed UK controls were also recruited. In all, 300 individuals consented, of whom 268 (89.3%) returned an oral fluid sample (OFS). The majority had worked in Sierra Leone in clinical, laboratory, research, and other roles. Fifty-three UK controls consented and provided samples using the same method. Of the returnees, 47 (17.5%) reported that they had had a possible EBOV exposure. Based on their free-text descriptions, using a published risk assessment method, we classified 43 (16%) as having had incidents with risk of Ebola transmission, including five intermediate-risk and one high-risk exposure. Of the returnees, 57 (21%) reported a febrile or diarrhoeal illness in West Africa or within 1 mo of return, of whom 40 (70%) were not tested at the time for EBOV infection. Of the 268 OFSs, 266 were unreactive. Two returnees, who did not experience an illness in West Africa or on return, had OFSs that were reactive on the EBOV IgG capture assay, with similar results on plasma. One individual had no further positive test results; the other had a positive result on a double-antigen bridging assay but not on a competitive assay or on an indirect EBOV IgG ELISA. All 53 controls had non-reactive OFSs. While the participants were not a random sample of returnees, the number participating was high. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study, to our knowledge, of the prevalence of EBOV infection in international responders. More than 99% had clear negative results. Sera from two individuals had discordant results on the different assays; both were negative on the competitive assay, suggesting that prior infection was unlikely. The finding that a significant proportion experienced ""near miss"" exposure events, and that most of those who experienced symptoms did not get tested for EBOV at the time, suggests a need to review and standardise protocols for the management of possible exposure to EBOV, and for the management of illness, across organisations that deploy staff to outbreaks.",2017,May,PLoS Med,14,5,e1002300,28510604,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002300,,#4168,Houlihan 2017,"",""

We have determined additional full-length sequences from two clusters of imported EBOV infections into Mali, and we show that the nucleotide substitution rate (9.6 x 10(-4) substitutions per site per year) is consistent with rates observed in Central African outbreaks.

The objective of this study was to show how a road density index (RDI) could be constructed and a study of its association with Ebola cases during the outbreak. The study was carried out at the district level across the affected countries. RDI was calculated by km2 of territory as a proxy for the mobility of the population. To calculate this index, the number of km of road constructed in each district was estimated and subsequently divided by the area of each district expressed in km2. The accumulated incidence of Ebola was calculated per district. A generalised linear model with a Poisson distribution was used. The RDI varied from 0.12 to 0.84 between the districts. An RDI increase of 0.01 indicates a 3% increase in Ebola infection risk (RR is 1.03; CI 1.03-1.04).

Assessing the international spreading risk associated with the 2014 west african ebola outbreak,"Gomes, M. F.; Pastore, Y. Piontti A.; Rossi, L.; Chao, D.; Longini, I.; Halloran, M. E.; Vespignani, A.","BACKGROUND: The 2014 West African Ebola Outbreak is so far the largest and deadliest recorded in history. The affected countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, have been struggling to contain and to mitigate the outbreak. The ongoing rise in confirmed and suspected cases, 2615 as of 20 August 2014, is considered to increase the risk of international dissemination, especially because the epidemic is now affecting cities with major commercial airports. METHOD: We use the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model to generate stochastic, individual based simulations of epidemic spread worldwide, yielding, among other measures, the incidence and seeding events at a daily resolution for 3,362 subpopulations in 220 countries. The mobility model integrates daily airline passenger traffic worldwide and the disease model includes the community, hospital, and burial transmission dynamic. We use a multimodel inference approach calibrated on data from 6 July to the date of 9 August 2014. The estimates obtained were used to generate a 3-month ensemble forecast that provides quantitative estimates of the local transmission of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and the probability of international spread if the containment measures are not successful at curtailing the outbreak. RESULTS: We model the short-term growth rate of the disease in the affected West African countries and estimate the basic reproductive number to be in the range 1.5 - 2.0 (interval at the 1/10 relative likelihood). We simulated the international spreading of the outbreak and provide the estimate for the probability of Ebola virus disease case importation in countries across the world. RESULTS indicate that the short-term (3 and 6 weeks) probability of international spread outside the African region is small, but not negligible. The extension of the outbreak is more likely occurring in African countries, increasing the risk of international dissemination on a longer time scale.",2014,Sep 2,PLoS Curr,6,,,25642360,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.cd818f63d40e24aef769dda7df9e0da5,,#4233,Gomes 2014,"",""

Asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus could contribute to population immunity, reducing spread. If people with asymptomatic infection are infectious it could explain re-emergences of Ebola virus disease (EVD) without known contact. METHODS: We validated a new oral fluid anti-glycoprotein IgG capture assay among survivors from Kerry Town Ebola Treatment Centre and controls from communities unaffected by EVD in Sierra Leone. We then assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies to Ebola virus in a cross-sectional study of household contacts of the survivors. All household members were interviewed. Two reactive tests were required for a positive result, with a third test to resolve any discrepancies. FINDINGS: The assay had a specificity of 100% (95% CI 98.9-100; 339 of 339 controls tested negative) and sensitivity of 95.9% (89.8-98.9; 93 of 97 PCR-confirmed survivors tested positive).

Among asymptomatic contacts, seropositivity was weakly correlated with exposure level. INTERPRETATION: This new highly specific and sensitive assay showed asymptomatic infection with Ebola virus was uncommon despite high exposure.

Depending on which distributions are used (e.g. discretized Erlang, Gamma, Beta, or Uniform distributions), we demonstrate that our formulation represents both a discretization of Erlang epidemic models and generalizations thereof.

The case fatality ratio (CFR: proportion of cases that are fatal) is a key indicator of disease severity useful for gauging the appropriate public health response and for evaluating treatment benefits, if estimated accurately. We analysed individual-level clinical outcome data from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone officially reported to the World Health Organization. The overall mean CFR was 62.9% (95% CI: 61.9% to 64.0%) among confirmed cases with recorded clinical outcomes. Age was the most important modifier of survival probabilities, but country, stage of the epidemic and whether patients were hospitalized also played roles. We developed a statistical analysis to detect outliers in CFR between districts of residence and treatment centres (TCs), adjusting for known factors influencing survival and identified eight districts and three TCs with a CFR significantly different from the average. From the current dataset, we cannot determine whether the observed variation in CFR seen by district or treatment centre reflects real differences in survival, related to the quality of care or other factors or was caused by differences in reporting practices or case ascertainment.This article is part of the themed issue 'The 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic: data, decision-making and disease control'.",2017,May 26,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,372,1721,,28396479,10.1098/rstb.2016.0308,,#4364,Garske 2017,"",""
Assessing the relationship between epidemic growth scaling and epidemic size: The 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa,"Ganyani, T.; Roosa, K.; Faes, C.; Hens, N.; Chowell, G.","We assess the relationship between epidemic size and the scaling of epidemic growth of Ebola epidemics at the level of administrative areas during the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. For this purpose, we quantify growth scaling parameters from the ascending phase of Ebola outbreaks comprising at least 7 weeks of epidemic growth. We then study how these parameters are associated with observed epidemic sizes. For validation purposes, we also analyse two historic Ebola outbreaks. We find a high monotonic association between the scaling of epidemic growth parameter and the observed epidemic size. For example, scaling of growth parameters around 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.6 and 0.6 are associated with epidemic sizes on the order of 350-460, 460-840 and 840-2500 cases, respectively. These results are not explained by differences in epidemic onset across affected areas. We also find the relationship between the scaling of epidemic growth parameter and the observed epidemic size to be consistent for two past Ebola outbreaks in Congo (1976) and Uganda (2000). Signature features of epidemic growth could become useful to assess the risk of observing a major epidemic outbreak, generate improved diseases forecasts and enhance the predictive power of epidemic models.

M.; Edmunds, W. J.","Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.",2019,Feb,PLoS Comput Biol,15,2,e1006785,30742608,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006785,,#4421,Funk 2019,"",""

Projected impact of vaccination timing and dose availability on the course of the 2014 west african ebola epidemic,"Fisman, D.; Tuite, A.","BACKGROUND: The 2014 West African Ebola outbreak has evolved into an epidemic of historical proportions and catastrophic scope. Prior outbreaks have been contained through the use of personal protective equipment, but such an approach has not been rapidly effective in the current epidemic. Several candidate vaccines have been developed against the Ebola virus, and are undergoing initial clinical trials. METHODS: As removal of population-level susceptibility through vaccination could be a highly impactful control measure for this epidemic, we sought to estimate the number of vaccine doses and timing of vaccine administration required to reduce the epidemic size. Our base model was fit using the IDEA approach, a single equation model that has been successful to date in describing Ebola growth. We projected the future course of the Ebola epidemic using this model. Vaccination was assumed to reduce the effective reproductive number. We evaluated the potential impact of vaccination on epidemic trajectory under different assumptions around timing of vaccine availability. RESULTS: Using effective reproductive (Re) number estimates derived from this model, we estimate that 3-4 million doses of vaccine, if available and administered, could reduce Re to 0.9 in the interval from January-March 2015. Later vaccination would be associated with a progressively diminishing impact on final epidemic size; in particular, vaccination to the same Re at or after the epidemic is projected to peak (April-May 2015) would have little impact on final epidemic size, though more intensive campaigns (e.g., Re reduced to 0.5) could still be effective if initiated by summer 2015. In summary, there is a closing window of opportunity for the use of vaccine as a tool for Ebola epidemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Effective vaccination, used before the epidemic peaks, would be projected to prevent tens of thousands of deaths; this does not minimize the ethical challenges that would be associated with wide-scale application of vaccines that have undergone only limited evaluation for safety and efficacy.",2014,Nov 21,PLoS Curr,6,,,25685616,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.06e00d0546ad426fed83ff24a1d4c4cc,,#4568,Fisman 2014,"",""

Limited data are available on the epidemiology of the outbreak. However, reported cumulative incidence data as well as death counts are available for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. We utilized a simple, two parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth and control, to characterize epidemic growth patterns in West Africa, to evaluate the degree to which the epidemic is being controlled, and to assess the potential implications of growth patterns for epidemic size. Models demonstrated good fits to data. Overall basic reproductive number (R0) for the epidemic was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.0, consistent with prior outbreaks. However, we identified only weak evidence for the occurrence of epidemic control in West Africa as a whole, and essentially no evidence for control in Liberia (though slowing of growth was seen in Guinea and Sierra Leone).

We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.",2017,Apr 20,Nature,544,7650,309-315,28405027,10.1038/nature22040,,#4764,Dudas 2017,"",""
Phylodynamic Model Adequacy Using Posterior Predictive Simulations,"Duchene, S.; Bouckaert, R.; Duchene, D. A.; Stadler, T.; Drummond, A. J.","Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, accumulate genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological processes occur, such that, it is possible to make inferences about their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it cannot generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy, a package for the popular BEAST2 software that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analyzing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola and H1N1 influenza. The main features of the Ebola data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1 influenza data were best described by the birth-death susceptible-infected-recovered model.",2019,Mar 1,Syst Biol,68,2,358-364,29945220,10.1093/sysbio/syy048,,#4766,Duchene 2019,Anne Cori (2019-10-29 22:50:04)(Select): R0 estimates; ,""
Modeling spatial invasion of Ebola in West Africa,"D'Silva, J. P.; Eisenberg, M. C.","The 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa was the largest ever recorded, representing a fundamental shift in Ebola epidemiology with unprecedented spatiotemporal complexity. To understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of EVD in West Africa, we developed spatial transmission models using a gravity-model framework at both the national and district-level scales, which we used to compare effectiveness of local interventions (e.g. local quarantine) and long-range interventions (e.g. border-closures). The country-level gravity model captures the epidemic data, including multiple waves of initial epidemic growth observed in Guinea. We found that local-transmission reductions were most effective in Liberia, while long-range transmission was dominant in Sierra Leone. Both models illustrated that interventions in one region result in an amplified protective effect on other regions by preventing spatial transmission. In the district-level model, interventions in the strongest of these amplifying regions reduced total cases in all three countries by over 20%, in spite of the region itself generating only approximately 0.1% of total cases. This model structure and associated intervention analysis provide information that can be used by public health policymakers to assist planning and response efforts for future epidemics.",2017,Sep 7,J Theor Biol,428,,65-75,28551366,10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.05.034,,#4778,D'Silva 2017,"",""
Ebola cases and health system demand in Liberia,"Drake, J. M.; Kaul, R. B.; Alexander, L. W.; O'Regan, S. M.; Kramer, A. M.; Pulliam, J. T.; Ferrari, M. J.; Park, A. W.","In 2014, a major epidemic of human Ebola virus disease emerged in West Africa, where human-to-human transmission has now been sustained for greater than 12 months. In the summer of 2014, there was great uncertainty about the answers to several key policy questions concerning the path to containment. What is the relative importance of nosocomial transmission compared with community-acquired infection? How much must hospital capacity increase to provide care for the anticipated patient burden? To which interventions will Ebola transmission be most responsive? What must be done to achieve containment? In recent years, epidemic models have been used to guide public health interventions. But, model-based policy relies on high quality causal understanding of transmission, including the availability of appropriate dynamic transmission models and reliable reporting about the sequence of case incidence for model fitting, which were lacking for this epidemic. To investigate the range of potential transmission scenarios, we developed a multi-type branching process model that incorporates key heterogeneities and time-varying parameters to reflect changing human behavior and deliberate interventions in Liberia. Ensembles of this model were evaluated at a set of parameters that were both epidemiologically plausible and capable of reproducing the observed trajectory. Results of this model suggested that epidemic outcome would depend on both hospital capacity and individual behavior. Simulations suggested that if hospital capacity was not increased, then transmission might outpace the rate of isolation and the ability to provide care for the ill, infectious, and dying. Similarly, the model suggested that containment would require individuals to adopt behaviors that increase the rates of case identification and isolation and secure burial of the deceased. As of mid-October, it was unclear that this epidemic would be contained even by 99% hospitalization at the planned hospital capacity. A new version of the model, updated to reflect information collected during October and November 2014, predicts a significantly more constrained set of possible futures. This model suggests that epidemic outcome still depends very heavily on individual behavior. Particularly, if future patient hospitalization rates return to background levels (estimated to be around 70%), then transmission is predicted to remain just below the critical point around Reff = 1. At the higher hospitalization rate of 85%, this model predicts near complete elimination in March to June, 2015.",2015,Jan,PLoS Biol,13,1,e1002056,25585384,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002056,,#4787,Drake 2015,"",""

Evaluation of Ebola spreading in West Africa and decision of optimal medicine delivery strategies based on mathematical models,"Dong, F.; Xu, D.; Wang, Z.; Dong, M.","This paper mainly focuses on Ebola prediction and optimal location of emergency supplies delivery in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. First, an epidemic model called SEIIRHF model which takes the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, the recovered, the ones in hospital and the buried into consideration is developed to evaluate Ebola propagation. In this model, the infected and the ones in hospital are divided into two categories, serious infected and not serious, to simulate Ebola patients who are in ICU or not. Data of total and death cases from WHO website are used to curve fit. Then the curve is tested by data acquired recently. According to the curve, we predict there are 4000 total cases and 2500 death cases in Guinea, 9509 total cases and 4166 death cases in Liberia, 12,556 total cases and 3933 death cases in Sierra Leone by end of June, 2015. Then Clustering method is adopted to divide the most serious regions in a country into several parts, each part has a location of medicine delivery.

Modeling the Spread of Ebola,"Do, T. S.; Lee, Y. S.","OBJECTIVES: This study aims to create a mathematical model to better understand the spread of Ebola, the mathematical dynamics of the disease, and preventative behaviors. METHODS: An epidemiological model is created with a system of nonlinear differential equations, and the model examines the disease transmission dynamics with isolation through stability analysis. All parameters are approximated, and results are also exploited by simulations. Sensitivity analysis is used to discuss the effect of intervention strategies. RESULTS: The system has only one equilibrium point, which is the disease-free state (S,L,I,R,D) = (N,0,0,0,0). If traditional burials of Ebola victims are allowed, the possible end state is never stable. Provided that safe burial practices with no traditional rituals are followed, the endemic-free state is stable if the basic reproductive number, R 0, is less than 1. Model behaviors correspond to empirical facts. The model simulation agrees with the data of the Nigeria outbreak in 2004: 12 recoveries, eight deaths, Ebola free in about 3 months, and an R 0 value of about 2.6 initially, which signifies swift spread of the infection. The best way to reduce R 0 is achieving the speedy net effect of intervention strategies. One day's delay in full compliance with building rings around the virus with isolation, close observation, and clear education may double the number of infected cases. CONCLUSION: The model can predict the total number of infected cases, number of deaths, and duration of outbreaks among others. The model can be used to better understand the spread of Ebola, educate about prophylactic behaviors, and develop strategies that alter environment to achieve a disease-free state. A future work is to incorporate vaccination in the model when the vaccines are developed and the effects of vaccines are known better.",2016,Feb,Osong Public Health Res Perspect,7,1,43-8,26981342,10.1016/j.phrp.2015.12.012,,#4828,Do 2016,"",""

We then tested if variation in reporting rates affected the estimates of disease transmission rates that were used in surveillance and response. We found significant variation in reporting rates among districts, and district-specific rates of increase in reporting over time.

A.; Cauchemez, S.","BACKGROUND: An epidemic of Ebola virus disease of unprecedented size continues in parts of west Africa. For the first time, large urban centres such as Conakry, the capital of Guinea, are affected. We did an observational study of patients with Ebola virus disease in three regions of Guinea, including Conakry, aiming to map the routes of transmission and assess the effect of interventions. METHODS: Between Feb 10, 2014, and Aug 25, 2014, we obtained data from the linelist of all confirmed and probable cases in Guinea (as of Sept 16, 2014), a laboratory database of information about patients, and interviews with patients and their families and neighbours. With this information, we mapped chains of transmission, identified which setting infections most probably originated from (community, hospitals, or funerals), and computed the context-specific and overall reproduction numbers. FINDINGS: Of 193 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola virus disease reported in Conakry, Boffa, and Telimele, 152 (79%) were positioned in chains of transmission. Health-care workers contributed little to transmission. In March, 2014, individuals with Ebola virus disease who were not health-care workers infected a mean of 2.3 people (95% CI 1.6-3.2): 1.4 (0.9-2.2) in the community, 0.4 (0.1-0.9) in hospitals, and 0.5 (0.2-1.0) at funerals. After the implementation of infection control in April, the reproduction number in hospitals and at funerals reduced to lower than 0.1. In the community, the reproduction number dropped by 50% for patients that were admitted to hospital, but remained unchanged for those that were not. In March, hospital transmissions constituted 35% (seven of 20) of all transmissions and funeral transmissions constituted 15% (three); but from April to the end of the study period, they constituted only 9% (11 of 128) and 4% (five), respectively. 82% (119 of 145) of transmission occurred in the community and 72% (105) between family members. Our simulations show that a 10% increase in hospital admissions could have reduced the length of chains by 26% (95% CI 4-45). INTERPRETATION: In Conakry, interventions had the potential to stop the epidemic, but reintroductions of the disease and poor cooperation of a few families led to prolonged low-level spread, showing the challenges of Ebola virus disease control in large urban centres.

This makes it difficult to define the baseline CFRs needed to evaluate treatments in the absence of randomized controls. Here, we investigate whether viremia in EVD patients may be used to evaluate baseline EVD CFRs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the laboratory and epidemiological records of patients with EVD confirmed by reverse transcription PCR hospitalized in the Conakry area, Guinea, between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. We used viremia and other variables to model the CFR. Data for 699 EVD patients were analyzed. In the week following symptom onset, mean viremia remained stable, and the CFR increased with viremia, V, from 21% (95% CI 16%-27%) for low viremia (V < 104.4 copies/ml) to 53% (95% CI 44%-61%) for intermediate viremia (104.4 </= V < 105.2 copies/ml) and 81% (95% CI 75%-87%) for high viremia (V >/= 105.2 copies/ml). Compared to adults (15-44 y old [y.o.]), the CFR was larger in young children (0-4 y.o.) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.44; 95% CI 1.02-5.86) and older adults (>/= 45 y.o.) (OR: 2.84; 95% CI 1.81-4.46) but lower in children (5-14 y.o.) (OR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.86). An order of magnitude increase in mean viremia in cases after July 2014 compared to those before coincided with a 14% increase in the CFR. Our findings come from a large hospital-based study in Conakry and may not be generalizable to settings with different case profiles, such as with individuals who never sought care. CONCLUSIONS: Viremia in EVD patients was a strong predictor of death that partly explained variations in CFR in the study population. This study provides baseline CFRs by viremia group, which allow appropriate adjustment when estimating efficacy in treatment studies. In randomized controlled trials, stratifying analysis on viremia groups could reduce sample size requirements by 25%.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated 4,437 Ebola cases reported between February 28, 2014 and December 1, 2014 for Montserrado County to determine SES-stratified temporal trends and drivers of Ebola transmission. A dataset including dates of symptom onset, hospitalization, and death, and specified community of residence was used to stratify cases into high, middle and low SES. Additionally, information about 9,129 contacts was provided for a subset of 1,585 traced individuals. To evaluate transmission within and across socioeconomic subpopulations, as well as over the trajectory of the outbreak, we analyzed these data with a time-dependent stochastic model. Cases in the most impoverished communities reported three more contacts on average than cases in high SES communities (p<0.001). Our transmission model shows that infected individuals from middle and low SES communities were associated with 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6) and 3.5 (95% CI: 3.1-3.9) times as many secondary cases as those from high SES communities, respectively. Furthermore, most of the spread of Ebola across Montserrado County originated from areas of lower SES. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Individuals from areas of poverty were associated with high rates of transmission and spread of Ebola to other regions. Thus, Ebola could most effectively be prevented or contained if disease interventions were targeted to areas of extreme poverty and funding was dedicated to development projects that meet basic needs.",2015,Dec,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,9,12,e0004260,26720278,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004260,,#5005,Fallah 2015,"",""
Dynamics of Ebola epidemics in West Africa 2014,"Evans, R. J.; Mammadov, M.","This paper investigates the dynamics of Ebola virus transmission in West Africa during 2014. The reproduction numbers for the total period of epidemic and for different consequent time intervals are estimated based on a simple linear model. It contains one major parameter - the average infectious period that defines the dynamics of epidemics. Numerical implementations are carried out on data collected from three countries Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as well as the total data collected worldwide.

Assessment of the risk of ebola importation to australia,"Cope, R. C.; Cassey, P.; Hugo, G. J.; Ross, J. V.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of Ebola importation to Australia during the first six months of 2015, based upon the current outbreak in West Africa. METHODOLOGY: We assessed the risk under two distinct scenarios: (i) assuming that significant numbers of cases of Ebola remain confined to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and using historic passenger arrival data into Australia; and, (ii) assuming potential secondary spread based upon international flight data. A model appropriate to each scenario is developed, and parameterised using passenger arrival card or international flight data, and World Health Organisation case data from West Africa. These models were constructed based on WHO Ebola outbreak data as at 17 October 2014 and 3 December 2014. An assessment of the risk under each scenario is reported. On 27 October 2014 the Australian Government announced a policy change, that visas from affected countries would be refused/cancelled, and the predicted effect of this policy change is reported. RESULTS: The current probability of at least one case entering Australia by 1 July 2015, having travelled directly from West Africa with historic passenger arrival rates into Australia, is 0.34. Under the new Australian Government policy of restricting visas from affected countries (as of 27 October 2014), the probability of at least one case entering Australia by 1 July 2015 is reduced to 0.16. The probability of at least one case entering Australia by 1 July 2015 via an outbreak from a secondary source country is approximately 0.12. CONCLUSIONS: Our models suggest that if the transmission of Ebola remains unchanged, it is possible that a case will enter Australia within the first six months of 2015, either directly from West Africa (even when current visa restrictions are considered), or via secondary outbreaks elsewhere. Government and medical authorities should be prepared to respond to this eventuality. Control measures within West Africa over recent months have contributed to a reduction in projected risk of a case entering Australia. A significant further reduction of the rate at which Ebola is proliferating in West Africa, and control of the disease if and when it proliferates elsewhere, will continue to result in substantially lower risk of the disease entering Australia.",2014,Dec 10,PLoS Curr,6,,,25685627,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.aa0375fd48a92c7c9422aa543a88711f,,#5057,Cope 2014,"",""

Here, we validate the systematic collection of Internet news reports to characterize epidemiological patterns of Ebola virus disease (EVD) infections during the West African 2014-2015 outbreak. METHODS: Based on 58 news reports, we analyzed 79 EVD clusters (286 cases) ranging in size from 1 to 33 cases between January 2014 and February 2015 in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. RESULTS: The majority of reported exposures stemmed from contact with family members (57.3%) followed by hospitals (18.2%) and funerals (12.7%). Our data indicate that funeral exposure was significantly more frequent in Sierra Leone (27.3%) followed by Guinea (18.2%) and Liberia (1.8%; chi(2) test; P < .0001). Funeral exposure was the dominant route of transmission until April 2014 (60%) and was replaced with hospital exposure in June 2014-July 2014 (70%), both of which declined after interventions were put in place. The mean reproduction number of the outbreak was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8, 2.7). The case fatality rate was estimated at 74.4% (95% CI, 68.3, 79.8). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings based on news reports are in close agreement with those derived from traditional epidemiological surveillance data and with those reported for prior outbreaks.

Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and 11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea.

Potential for large outbreaks of Ebola virus disease,"Camacho, A.; Kucharski, A. J.; Funk, S.; Breman, J.; Piot, P.; Edmunds, W. J.","Outbreaks of Ebola virus can cause substantial morbidity and mortality in affected regions. The largest outbreak of Ebola to date is currently underway in West Africa, with 3944 cases reported as of 5th September 2014. To develop a better understanding of Ebola transmission dynamics, we revisited data from the first known Ebola outbreak, which occurred in 1976 in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo). By fitting a mathematical model to time series stratified by disease onset, outcome and source of infection, we were able to estimate several epidemiological quantities that have previously proved challenging to measure, including the contribution of hospital and community infection to transmission. We found evidence that transmission decreased considerably before the closure of the hospital, suggesting that the decline of the outbreak was most likely the result of changes in host behaviour. Our analysis suggests that the person-to-person reproduction number was 1.34 (95% CI: 0.92-2.11) in the early part of the outbreak. Using stochastic simulations we demonstrate that the same epidemiological conditions that were present in 1976 could have generated a large outbreak purely by chance. At the same time, the relatively high person-to-person basic reproduction number suggests that Ebola would have been difficult to control through hospital-based infection control measures alone.",2014,Dec,Epidemics,9,,70-8,25480136,10.1016/j.epidem.2014.09.003,,#5252,Camacho 2014,"",""

As a result, the number of cases exceeded the capacity of Ebola holding and treatment centres. During December, additional beds were introduced, and incidence declined in many areas. We aimed to measure patterns of transmission in different regions, and evaluate whether bed capacity is now sufficient to meet future demand. METHODS: We used a mathematical model of EVD infection to estimate how the extent of transmission in the nine worst affected districts of Sierra Leone changed between 10th August 2014 and 18th January 2015. Using the model, we forecast the number of cases that could occur until the end of March 2015, and compared bed requirements with expected future capacity. RESULTS: We found that the reproduction number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual, declined between August and December in all districts. We estimated that R was near the crucial control threshold value of 1 in December. We further estimated that bed capacity has lagged behind demand between August and December for most districts, but as a consequence of the decline in transmission, control measures caught up with the epidemic in early 2015. CONCLUSIONS: EVD incidence has exhibited substantial temporal and geographical variation in Sierra Leone, but our results suggest that the epidemic may have now peaked in Sierra Leone, and that current bed capacity appears to be sufficient to keep the epidemic under-control in most districts.",2015,Feb 10,PLoS Curr,7,,,25737806,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.406ae55e83ec0b5193e30856b9235ed2,,#5253,Camacho 2015,"",""

We simulate trials under these forecasts and test potential start dates and rollout schemes to assess power to detect efficacy, and bias in vaccine efficacy estimates that may be introduced. RESULTS: Under realistic assumptions, we found that a trial of 100,000 participants starting after 1 August had less than 5% chance of having enough cases to detect vaccine efficacy. In particular, gradual recruitment precludes detection of vaccine efficacy because the epidemic is likely to go extinct before enough participants are recruited. Exclusion of early cases in either arm of the trial creates bias in vaccine efficacy estimates.

METHODS: In this retrospective, cross-sectional observational study, we recruited individuals between May 12, 2016, and Sept 8, 2017, who had been in physical contact with a patient with Ebola virus disease, from four medical centres in Guinea (Conakry, Macenta, N'zerekore, and Forecariah). Contact persons had to be 7 years or older and not diagnosed with Ebola virus disease. Participants were selected through the Postebogui survivors' cohort. We collected self-reported information on exposure and occurrence of symptoms after exposure using a questionnaire, and tested antibody response against glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and 40-kDa viral protein of Zaire Ebola virus by taking a blood sample. The prevalence of Ebola virus infection was estimated with a latent class model. FINDINGS: 1721 contact persons were interviewed and given blood tests, 331 of whom reported a history of vaccination so were excluded, resulting in a study population of 1390. Symptoms were reported by 216 (16%) contact persons. The median age of participants was 26 years (range 7-88) and 682 (49%) were male. Seropositivity was identified in 18 (8.33%, 95% CI 5.01-12.80) of 216 paucisymptomatic contact persons and 39 (3.32%, 5.01-12.80) of 1174 (2-4) asymptomatic individuals (p=0.0021). Seropositivity increased with participation in burial rituals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.21-4.17; p=0.0079) and exposure to blood or vomit (aOR 2.15, 1.23-3.91; p=0.0090).

Novel Ordered Stepped-Wedge Cluster Trial Designs for Detecting Ebola Vaccine Efficacy Using a Spatially Structured Mathematical Model,"Diakite, I.; Mooring, E. Q.; Velasquez, G. E.; Murray, M. B.","BACKGROUND: During the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, policy-makers were confronted with difficult decisions on how best to test the efficacy of EVD vaccines. On one hand, many were reluctant to withhold a vaccine that might prevent a fatal disease from study participants randomized to a control arm. On the other, regulatory bodies called for rigorous placebo-controlled trials to permit direct measurement of vaccine efficacy prior to approval of the products. A stepped-wedge cluster study (SWCT) was proposed as an alternative to a more traditional randomized controlled vaccine trial to address these concerns. Here, we propose novel ""ordered stepped-wedge cluster trial"" (OSWCT) designs to further mitigate tradeoffs between ethical concerns, logistics, and statistical rigor. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a spatially structured mathematical model of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. We used the output of this model to simulate and compare a series of stepped-wedge cluster vaccine studies. Our model reproduced the observed order of first case occurrence within districts of Sierra Leone. Depending on the infection risk within the trial population and the trial start dates, the statistical power to detect a vaccine efficacy of 90% varied from 14% to 32% for standard SWCT, and from 67% to 91% for OSWCTs for an alpha error of 5%. The model's projection of first case occurrence was robust to changes in disease natural history parameters. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ordering clusters in a step-wedge trial based on the cluster's underlying risk of infection as predicted by a spatial model can increase the statistical power of a SWCT.

Modeling the impact of quarantine during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease,"Denes, A.; Gumel, A. B.","The quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to an infectious agent is one of the most basic public health measure that has historically been used to combat the spread of communicable diseases in human communities. This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to disease on the spread of the 2014-2015 outbreaks of Ebola viral disease. It is assumed that quarantine is imperfect (i.e., individuals can acquire infection during quarantine). In the absence of quarantine, the model is shown to exhibit global dynamics with respect to the disease-free and its unique endemic equilibrium when a certain epidemiological threshold (denoted by R 0 ) is either less than or greater than unity. Thus, unlike the full model with imperfect quarantine (which is known to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation), the version of the model with no quarantine does not undergo a backward bifurcation. Using data relevant to the 2014-2015 Ebola transmission dynamics in the three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), uncertainty analysis of the model show that, although the current level and effectiveness of quarantine can lead to significant reduction in disease burden, they fail to bring the associated quarantine reproduction number ( R 0 Q ) to a value less than unity (which is needed to make effective disease control or elimination feasible). This reduction of R 0 Q is, however, very possible with a modest increase in quarantine rate and effectiveness. It is further shown, via sensitivity analysis, that the parameters related to the effectiveness of quarantine (namely the parameter associated with the reduction in infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals and the contact rate during quarantine) are the main drivers of the disease transmission dynamics. Overall, this study shows that the singular implementation of a quarantine intervention strategy can lead to the effective control or elimination of Ebola viral disease in a community if its coverage and effectiveness levels are high enough.",2019,,Infect Dis Model,4,,12-27,30828672,10.1016/j.idm.2019.01.003,,#5323,Denes 2019,"",""
Bayesian reconstruction of transmission within outbreaks using genomic variants,"De Maio, N.; Worby, C. J.; Wilson, D. J.; Stoesser, N.","Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2.

We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore these factors in a rural village that experienced sustained EVD transmission in Kailahun District, Sierra Leone. METHODS: We reconstructed transmission dynamics using a cross-sectional survey conducted in April 2015, and cross-referenced our results with surveillance, burial, and Ebola Management Centre (EMC) data. Factors associated with EVD transmission were assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression. Following the survey, qualitative semi-structured interviews explored views of community informants and households. RESULTS: All households (n = 240; 1161 individuals) participated in the survey. 29 of 31 EVD probable/confirmed cases died (93.5% case fatality rate); six deaths (20.6%) had been missed by other surveillance systems. Transmission over five generations lasted 16 weeks. Although most households had </=5 members there was a significant increase in risk of Ebola in households with > 5 members. Risk of EVD was also associated with older age. Cases were spatially clustered; all occurred in 15 households. EVD transmission was better understood when the community experience started to concord with public health messages being given. Perceptions of contact tracing changed from invading privacy and selling people to ensuring community safety. Burials in plastic bags, without female attendants or prayer, were perceived as dishonourable. Further reasons for low compliance were low EMC survival rates, family perceptions of a moral duty to provide care to relatives, poor communication with the EMC, and loss of livelihoods due to quarantine. Compliance with response measures increased only after the second generation, coinciding with the implementation of restrictive by-laws, return of the first survivor, reduced contact with dead bodies, and admission of patients to the EMC. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission occurred primarily in a few large households, with prolonged transmission and a high death toll. Return of a survivor to the village and more effective implementation of control strategies coincided with increased compliance to control measures, with few subsequent cases.

In each outbreak, the public health emergency was recognized and reported by alert clinicians, and the control of disease was facilitated through rapid, coordinated responses involving multiple agencies. Such collaboration between clinical and public health entities and among various agencies will be increasingly needed as surveillance and diagnostic capabilities for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are enhanced around the world.",1996,Dec,Infect Dis Clin North Am,10,4,917-37,8958175,,,#5419,Butler 1996,Sangeeta Bhatia (2019-09-27 01:05:43)(Select): Kitwit outbreak report; ,""
Testing Modeling Assumptions in the West Africa Ebola Outbreak,"Burghardt, K.; Verzijl, C.; Huang, J.; Ingram, M.; Song, B.; Hasne, M. P.","The Ebola virus in West Africa has infected almost 30,000 and killed over 11,000 people. Recent models of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have often made assumptions about how the disease spreads, such as uniform transmissibility and homogeneous mixing within a population. In this paper, we test whether these assumptions are necessarily correct, and offer simple solutions that may improve disease model accuracy. First, we use data and models of West African migration to show that EVD does not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD within country administrative divisions and find that it significantly decreases with population density. Finally, we test whether EVD strains have uniform transmissibility through a novel statistical test, and find that certain strains appear more often than expected by chance.",2016,Oct 10,Sci Rep,6,,34598,27721505,10.1038/srep34598,,#5453,Burghardt 2016,"",""

Modeling contact tracing in outbreaks with application to Ebola,"Browne, C.; Gulbudak, H.; Webb, G.","Contact tracing is an important control strategy for containing Ebola epidemics. From a modeling perspective, explicitly incorporating contact tracing with disease dynamics presents challenges, and population level effects of contact tracing are difficult to determine. In this work, we formulate and analyze a mechanistic SEIR type outbreak model which considers the key features of contact tracing, and we characterize the impact of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number, Re, of Ebola. In particular, we determine how relevant epidemiological properties such as incubation period, infectious period and case reporting, along with varying monitoring protocols, affect the efficacy of contact tracing. In the special cases of either perfect monitoring of traced cases or perfect reporting of all cases, we derive simple formulae for the critical proportion of contacts that need to be traced in order to bring the effective reproduction number Re below one. Also, in either case, we show that Re can be expressed completely in terms of observable reported case/tracing quantities, namely Re = k((1-q)/q)+km where k is the number of secondary traced infected contacts per primary untraced reported case, km is the number of secondary traced infected contacts per primary traced reported case and (1-q)/q is the odds that a reported case is not a traced contact. These formulae quantify contact tracing as both an intervention strategy that impacts disease spread and a probe into the current epidemic status at the population level. Data from the West Africa Ebola outbreak is utilized to form real-time estimates of Re, and inform our projections of the impact of contact tracing, and other control measures, on the epidemic trajectory.",2015,Nov 7,J Theor Biol,384,,33-49,26297316,10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.08.004,,#5476,Browne 2015,"",""

These include: more complete use of the underlying compartmental dynamics than common alternatives, use as a potential diagnostic tool to detect the presence and causes of intensity process underfitting, and the ability to provide timely feedback on disease spread. Conceptual connections between traditional reproduction measures and our approach are explored, and the behavior of our method is examined under simulation. Two illustrative examples are developed: First, the single location applications of our method are established using data from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a traditional stochastic SEIR model. Second, a spatial formulation of this technique is explored in the context of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa with particular emphasis on potential use in model selection, diagnosis, and the resulting applications to estimation and prediction.

R.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of fatal recrudescence from Ebola virus disease after discharge from treatment centres, and explore the influence of infecting dose on case fatality rates. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Western Area, Sierra Leone. PARTICIPANTS: 151 survivors treated for Ebola virus disease at the Kerry Town treatment centre and discharged. Survivors were followed up for a vital status check at four to nine months after discharge, and again at six to 13 months after discharge. Verbal autopsies were conducted for four survivors who had died since discharge (that is, late deaths). Survivors still living in Western Area were interviewed together with their household members. Exposure level to Ebola virus disease was ascertained as a proxy of infecting dose, including for those who died. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risks and causes of late death; case fatality rates; odds ratios of death from Ebola virus disease by age, sex, exposure level, date, occupation, and household risk factors. RESULTS: Follow-up information was obtained on all 151 survivors of Ebola virus disease, a mean of 10 months after discharge. Four deaths occurred after discharge, all within six weeks: two probably due to late complications, one to prior tuberculosis, and only one after apparent full recovery, giving a maximum estimate of recrudescence leading to death of 0.7%. In these households, 395 people were reported to have had Ebola virus disease, of whom 227 died. A further 53 people fulfilled the case definition for probable disease, of whom 11 died. Therefore, the case fatality rate was 57.5% (227/395) for reported Ebola virus disease, or 53.1% (238/448) including probable disease. Case fatality rates were higher in children aged under 2 years and adults older than 30 years, in larger households, and in infections occurring earlier in the epidemic in Sierra Leone. There was no consistent trend of case fatality rate with exposure level, although increasing exposure increased the risk of Ebola virus disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of survivors in Western Area, Sierra Leone, late recrudescence of severe Ebola virus disease appears to be rare.

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Household members of EVD survivors from the Kerry Town Ebola Treatment Centre in Sierra Leone were interviewed four to 10 months after discharge to establish exposure levels for all members of the household, whether or not they became ill, and including those who died. We analysed a cohort of children under three years to examine associations between maternal illness, survival and breastfeeding, and the child's outcome. Of 77 children aged zero to two years in the households we surveyed, 43% contracted EVD. 64 children and mothers could be linked: 25/40 (63%) of those whose mother had EVD developed EVD, compared to 2/24 (8%) whose mother did not have EVD, relative risk adjusted for age, sex and other exposures (aRR) 7.6, 95%CI 2.0-29.1. Among those with mothers with EVD, the risk of EVD in the child was higher if the mother died (aRR 1.5, 0.99-2.4), but there was no increased risk associated with breast-feeding (aRR 0.75, 0.46-1.2). Excluding those breastfed by infected mothers, half (11/22) of the children with direct contact with EVD cases with wet symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting or haemorrhage) remained well. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the largest study of mother-child pairs with EVD to date, and the first attempt at assessing excess risk from breastfeeding. For young children the key exposure associated with contracting EVD was mother's illness with EVD, with a higher risk if the mother died.

We describe the course of the EHF outbreak in Masindi, Uganda, in the year 2000, and report on response activities. METHODS: We analysed surveillance records, hospital statistics, and our own observations during response activities. We used Fisher's exact tests for differences in proportions, t-tests for differences in means, and logistic regression for multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The response to the outbreak consisted of surveillance, case management, logistics and public mobilisation. Twenty-six EHF cases (24 laboratory confirmed, two probable) occurred between October 21st and December 22nd, 2000. CFP was 69% (18/26). Nosocomial transmission to the index case occurred in Lacor hospital in Gulu, outside the Ebola ward. After returning home to Masindi district the index case became the origin of a transmission chain within her own extended family (18 further cases), from index family members to health care workers (HCWs, 6 cases), and from HCWs to their household contacts (1 case). Five out of six occupational cases of EHF in HCWs occurred after the introduction of barrier nursing, probably due to breaches of barrier nursing principles. CFP was initially very high (76%) but decreased (20%) due to better case management after reinforcing the response team. The mobilisation of the community for the response efforts was challenging at the beginning, when fear, panic and mistrust had to be countered by the response team. CONCLUSIONS: Large scale transmission in the community beyond the index family was prevented by early case identification and isolation as well as quarantine imposed by the community. The high number of occupational EHF after implementing barrier nursing points at the need to strengthen training and supervision of local HCWs. The difference in CFP before and after reinforcing the response team together with observations on the ward suggest a critical role for intensive supportive treatment.

A prophylactic vaccine for ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) has been developed, and clinical trials show near-perfect efficacy. We have developed an ordinary differential equations model that simulates an EVD epidemic and takes into account (1) transmission through contact with infectious EVD individuals and deceased EVD bodies, (2) the heterogeneity of the risk of becoming infected with EVD, and (3) the increased survival rate of infected EVD patients due to greater access to trained healthcare providers.

The role of interconnectivity in control of an Ebola epidemic,"Blackwood, J. C.; Childs, L.

During the epidemic there was no known vaccine or drug, so effective disease control required coordinated efforts that include both standard medical and community practices such as hospitalization, quarantine and safe burials. Due to the high connectivity of the region, control of the epidemic not only depended on internal strategies but also was impacted by neighboring countries.

We develop an SIR-type model which, incorporates both the direct and indirect transmissions in such a manner that there is a provision of Ebola viruses. We prove that the full model has one (endemic) equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable whereas, it is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of the Ebola virus shedding in the environment. For the sub-model without the provision of Ebola viruses, the disease dies out or stabilizes globally at an endemic equilibrium.

Modeling ebola virus disease transmissions with reservoir in a complex virus life ecology,"Berge, T.; Bowong, S.; Lubuma, J.; Manyombe, M. L. M.","We propose a new deterministic mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in a complex Ebola virus life ecology. Our model captures as much as possible the features and patterns of the disease evolution as a three cycle transmission process in the two ways below. Firstly it involves the synergy between the epizootic phase (during which the disease circulates periodically amongst non-human primates populations and decimates them), the enzootic phase (during which the disease always remains in fruit bats population) and the epidemic phase (during which the EVD threatens and decimates human populations). Secondly it takes into account the well-known, the probable/suspected and the hypothetical transmission mechanisms (including direct and indirect routes of contamination) between and within the three different types of populations consisting of humans, animals and fruit bats. The reproduction number R0 for the full model with the environmental contamination is derived and the global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium is established when R0andlt;1. It is conjectured that there exists a unique globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium for the full model when R0andgt;1. The role of a contaminated environment is assessed by comparing the human infected component for the sub-model without the environment with that of the full model. Similarly, the sub-model without animals on the one hand and the sub-model without bats on the other hand are studied. It is shown that bats influence more the dynamics of EVD than the animals. Global sensitivity analysis shows that the effective contact rate between humans and fruit bats and the mortality rate for bats are the most influential parameters on the latent and infected human individuals. Numerical simulations, apart from supporting the theoretical results and the existence of a unique globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium for the full model, suggest further that: (1) fruit bats are more important in the transmission processes and the endemicity level of EVD than animals. This is in line with biological findings which identified bats as reservoir of Ebola viruses; (2) the indirect environmental contamination is detrimental to human beings, while it is almost insignificant for the transmission in bats.",2018,Feb 1,Math Biosci Eng,15,1,21-56,29161826,10.3934/mbe.2018002,,#5830,Berge 2018,"",""

In this study, I describe the EBOV epidemic using an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and fit the model to the most recent reported data of infected cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The maximum likelihood estimates of the basic reproduction number are 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-1.52) for Guinea, 2.53 (95% CI: 2.41-2.67) for Sierra Leone and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.57-1.60) for Liberia.

Our stability analysis on the first model (influenza infection) reveals two equilibrium points for the SIR model that describe endemic scenarios where both susceptible and infected cases maintain nonzero population sizes. Consequently, the between-host system has two bifurcations determined by the corresponding basic reproduction number of the within-host and the size of the infected population at the interior equilibrium point.

On January 10th, 2015, the district was the first to be declared Ebola-free by local authorities after 49 cases and a case fatality rate of 85.7%. The Pujehun outbreak represents a precious opportunity for improving the body of work on the transmission characteristics and effects of control interventions during the 2014-2015 EVD epidemic in West Africa. METHODS: By integrating hospital registers and contact tracing form data with healthcare worker and local population interviews, we reconstructed the transmission chain and investigated the key time periods of EVD transmission. The impact of intervention measures has been assessed using a microsimulation transmission model calibrated with the collected data. RESULTS: The mean incubation period was 9.7 days (range, 6-15). Hospitalization rate was 89%. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4.5 days (range, 1-9). The mean serial interval was 13.7 days (range, 2-18). The distribution of the number of secondary cases (R 0 = 1.63) was well fitted by a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter k = 0.45 (95% CI, 0.19-1.32). Overall, 74.3% of transmission events occurred between members of the same family or extended family, 17.9% in the community, mainly between friends, and 7.7% in hospital. The mean number of contacts investigated per EVD case raised from 11.5 in July to 25 in September 2014. In total, 43.0% of cases were detected through contact investigation. Model simulations suggest that the most important factors determining the probability of disease elimination are the number of EVD beds, the mean time from symptom onset to isolation, and the mean number of contacts traced per case. By assuming levels and timing of interventions performed in Pujehun, the estimated probability of eliminating an otherwise large EVD outbreak is close to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Containment of EVD in Pujehun district is ascribable to both the natural history of the disease (mainly transmitted through physical contacts, long generation time, overdispersed distribution of secondary cases per single primary case) and intervention measures (isolation of cases and contact tracing), which in turn strongly depend on preparedness, population awareness, and compliance.

E.; Vespignani, A.","BACKGROUND: Among the three countries most affected by the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014-2015, Guinea presents an unusual spatiotemporal epidemic pattern, with several waves and a long tail in the decay of the epidemic incidence. METHODS: Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model at the level of a single household that integrates detailed data on Guinean demography, hospitals, Ebola treatment units, contact tracing, and safe burial interventions. The microsimulation-based model is used to assess the effect of each control strategy and the probability of elimination of the epidemic according to different intervention scenarios, including ring vaccination with the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored vaccine. RESULTS: The numerical results indicate that the dynamics of the Ebola epidemic in Guinea can be quantitatively explained by the timeline of the implemented interventions. In particular, the early availability of Ebola treatment units and the associated isolation of cases and safe burials helped to limit the number of Ebola cases experienced by Guinea. We provide quantitative evidence of a strong negative correlation between the time series of cases and the number of traced contacts. This result is confirmed by the computational model that suggests that contact tracing effort is a key determinant in the control and elimination of the disease. In data-driven microsimulations, we find that tracing at least 5-10 contacts per case is crucial in preventing epidemic resurgence during the epidemic elimination phase. The computational model is used to provide an analysis of the ring vaccination trial highlighting its potential effect on disease elimination.

Optimal control analysis of Ebola disease with control strategies of quarantine and vaccination,"Ahmad, M. D.; Usman, M.; Khan, A.; Imran, M.","BACKGROUND: The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history, affecting multiple countries in West Africa. Some isolated cases were also observed in other regions of the world. METHOD: In this paper, we introduce a deterministic SEIR type model with additional hospitalization, quarantine and vaccination components in order to understand the disease dynamics. Optimal control strategies, both in the case of hospitalization (with and without quarantine) and vaccination are used to predict the possible future outcome in terms of resource utilization for disease control and the effectiveness of vaccination on sick populations. Further, with the help of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis we also have identified the most sensitive parameters which effectively contribute to change the disease dynamics. We have performed mathematical analysis with numerical simulations and optimal control strategies on Ebola virus models. RESULTS: We used dynamical system tools with numerical simulations and optimal control strategies on our Ebola virus models. The original model, which allowed transmission of Ebola virus via human contact, was extended to include imperfect vaccination and quarantine. After the qualitative analysis of all three forms of Ebola model, numerical techniques, using MATLAB as a platform, were formulated and analyzed in detail. Our simulation results support the claims made in the qualitative section. CONCLUSION: Our model incorporates an important component of individuals with high risk level with exposure to disease, such as front line health care workers, family members of EVD patients and Individuals involved in burial of deceased EVD patients, rather than the general population in the affected areas. Our analysis suggests that in order for R 0 (i.e., the basic reproduction number) to be less than one, which is the basic requirement for the disease elimination, the transmission rate of isolated individuals should be less than one-fourth of that for non-isolated ones. Our analysis also predicts, we need high levels of medication and hospitalization at the beginning of an epidemic.

Mathematical assessment of the effect of traditional beliefs and customs on the transmission dynamics of the 2014 Ebola outbreaks,"Agusto, F. B.; Teboh-Ewungkem, M. I.; Gumel, A. B.","BACKGROUND: Ebola is one of the most virulent human viral diseases, with a case fatality ratio between 25% to 90%. The 2014 West African outbreaks are the largest and worst in history. There is no specific treatment or effective/safe vaccine against the disease. Hence, control efforts are restricted to basic public health preventive (non-pharmaceutical) measures. Such efforts are undermined by traditional/cultural belief systems and customs, characterized by general mistrust and skepticism against government efforts to combat the disease. This study assesses the roles of traditional customs and public healthcare systems on the disease spread. METHODS: A mathematical model is designed and used to assess population-level impact of basic non-pharmaceutical control measures on the 2014 Ebola outbreaks. The model incorporates the effects of traditional belief systems and customs, along with disease transmission within health-care settings and by Ebola-deceased individuals. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine model parameters that most affect disease transmission. The model is parameterized using data from Guinea, one of the three Ebola-stricken countries. Numerical simulations are performed and the parameters that drive disease transmission, with or without basic public health control measures, determined. Three effectiveness levels of such basic measures are considered. RESULTS: The distribution of the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for Guinea (in the absence of basic control measures) is such that [Formula: see text], for the case when the belief systems do not result in more unreported Ebola cases. When such systems inhibit control efforts, the distribution increases to [Formula: see text]. The total Ebola cases are contributed by Ebola-deceased individuals (22%), symptomatic individuals in the early (33%) and latter (45%) infection stages. A significant reduction of new Ebola cases can be achieved by increasing health-care workers' daily shifts from 8 to 24 hours, limiting hospital visitation to 1 hour and educating the populace to abandon detrimental traditional/cultural belief systems. CONCLUSIONS: The 2014 outbreaks are controllable using a moderately-effective basic public health intervention strategy alone.

Mathematical model of Ebola transmission dynamics with relapse and reinfection,"Agusto, F. B.","The Ebola virus disease is caused by the Ebola virus which belongs to the filoviridae virus family. The 2014 outbreaks were estimated to have caused over 11,000 fatalities. In this paper, we formulate and analyze a system of ordinary differential equations which incorporates disease relapse and reinfection. The Ebola model with disease relapse and reinfection is locally-asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The model exhibits in the presence of disease reinfection, the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where the stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with a stable endemic equilibrium when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The feasibility of backward bifurcation occurring increases with increasing values of both relapse and reinfection. The total number of new cases of Ebola-infected individuals increases with increasing values of the relapse and reinfection parameters. Further simulations show that Ebola transmission models that do not incorporate relapse and reinfection may under-estimate disease burden in the community. Similar under-estimation is observed in models that include only one infected and recovered classes. Using results obtained from sensitivity analysis indicates that Ebola (given disease relapse and reinfection) can be effectively curtailed in the community by using control measures with a high-effectiveness level.

As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable Ebola (""cases"") were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases (""potential source contacts"") in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHO's response during the epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529 cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were reported by 33% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = -0.37, p < 0.001) between R and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within </=4 days of symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14% of potential source contacts as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20% of cases accounting for at least 73% of new infections, a phenomenon often called super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation, older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly (especially dates, and possible misclassifications). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.",2016,Nov,PLoS Med,13,11,e1002170,27846234,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002170,,#5940,Agua-Agum 2016,"",""

Household demographic determinants of Ebola epidemic risk,"Adams, B.","A salient characteristic of Ebola, and some other infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis, is intense transmission among small groups of cohabitants and relatively limited indiscriminate transmission in the wider population. Here we consider a mathematical model for an Ebola epidemic in a population structured into households of equal size. We show that household size, a fundamental demographic unit, is a critical factor that determines the vulnerability of a community to epidemics, and the effort required to control them. Our analysis is based on the household reproduction number, but we also consider the basic reproduction number, intrinsic growth rate and final epidemic size. We show that, when other epidemiological parameters are kept the same, all of these quantifications of epidemic growth and size are increased by larger households and more intense within-household transmission. We go on to model epidemic control by case detection and isolation followed by household quarantine. We show that, if household quarantine is ineffective, the critical probability with which cases must be detected to halt an epidemic increases significantly with each increment in household size and may be a very challenging target for communities composed of large households. Effective quarantine may, however, mitigate the detrimental impact of large household sizes. We conclude that communities composed of large households are fundamentally more vulnerable to epidemics of infectious diseases primarily transmitted by close contact, and any assessment of control strategies for these epidemics should take into account the demographic structure of the population.",2016,Mar 7,J Theor Biol,392,,99-106,26718863,10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.11.025,,#5975,Adams 2016,"",""
Potential Impact of Sexual Transmission on Ebola Virus Epidemiology: Sierra Leone as a Case Study,"Abbate, J. L.; Murall, C. L.; Richner, H.; Althaus, C. L.","BACKGROUND: Sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 6 months after onset of symptoms has been recently documented, and Ebola virus RNA has been detected in semen of survivors up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We devised a compartmental mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68-98 days] (p < 0.0001) on average. Strikingly, a 6-month convalescent period extended the average epidemic by 540 days (95% CI: 508-572 days), doubling the current length, despite an insignificant rise in the number of new cases generated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that reductions in the per sex act transmission probability via abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not significantly reduce the epidemic size and may only minimally shorten the length of time the public health community must maintain response preparedness. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts.",2016,May,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,5,e0004676,27135922,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004676,,#5997,Abbate 2016,"",""
"Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, April-May, 2018: an epidemiological study","","BACKGROUND: On May 8, 2018, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Equateur Province in the northwest of the country. The remoteness of most affected communities and the involvement of an urban centre connected to the capital city and neighbouring countries makes this outbreak the most complex and high risk ever experienced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We provide early epidemiological information arising from the ongoing investigation of this outbreak. METHODS: We classified cases as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministere de la Sante Publique. We investigated all cases to obtain demographic characteristics, determine possible exposures, describe signs and symptoms, and identify contacts to be followed up for 21 days. We also estimated the reproduction number and projected number of cases for the 4-week period from May 25, to June 21, 2018. FINDINGS: As of May 30, 2018, 50 cases (37 confirmed, 13 probable) of Zaire ebolavirus were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 21 (42%) were reported in Bikoro, 25 (50%) in Iboko, and four (8%) in Wangata health zones. Wangata is part of Mbandaka, the urban capital of Equateur Province, which is connected to major national and international transport routes. By May 30, 2018, 25 deaths from Ebola virus disease had been reported, with a case fatality ratio of 56% (95% CI 39-72) after adjustment for censoring. This case fatality ratio is consistent with estimates for the 2014-16 west African Ebola virus disease epidemic (p=0.427). The median age of people with confirmed or probable infection was 40 years (range 8-80) and 30 (60%) were male. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms in people with confirmed or probable Ebola virus disease were fever (40 [95%] of 42 cases), intense general fatigue (37 [90%] of 41 cases), and loss of appetite (37 [90%] of 41 cases). Gastrointestinal symptoms were frequently reported, and 14 (33%) of 43 people reported haemorrhagic signs. Time from illness onset and hospitalisation to sample testing decreased over time. By May 30, 2018, 1458 contacts had been identified, of which 746 (51%) remained under active follow-up. The estimated reproduction number was 1.03 (95% credible interval 0.83-1.37) and the cumulative case incidence for the outbreak by June 21, 2018, is projected to be 78 confirmed cases (37-281), assuming heterogeneous transmissibility. INTERPRETATION: The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Early detection, rapid patient isolation, contact tracing, and the ongoing vaccination programme should sufficiently control the outbreak. The forecast of the number of cases does not exceed the current capacity to respond if the epidemiological situation does not change. The information presented, although preliminary, has been essential in guiding the ongoing investigation and response to this outbreak.

P.; De Lamballerie, X.; Kazanji, M.; Leroy, E.

The survey lasted three years and covered 4,349 individuals from 220 randomly selected villages, representing 10.7% of all villages in Gabon. Using a sensitive and specific ELISA method, we found a ZEBOV-specific IgG seroprevalence of 15.3% overall, the highest ever reported. The seroprevalence rate was significantly higher in forested areas (19.4%) than in other ecosystems, namely grassland (12.4%), savannah (10.5%), and lakeland (2.7%). No other risk factors for seropositivity were found. The specificity of anti-ZEBOV IgG was confirmed by Western blot in 138 individuals, and CD8 T cells from seven IgG+ individuals were shown to produce IFN-gamma after ZEBOV stimulation. Together, these findings show that a large fraction of the human population living in forested areas of Gabon has both humoral and cellular immunity to ZEBOV. In the absence of identified risk factors, the high prevalence of ""immune"" persons suggests a common source of human exposure such as fruits contaminated by bat saliva. These findings provide significant new insights into ZEBOV circulation and human exposure, and raise important questions as to the human pathogenicity of ZEBOV and the existence of natural protective immunization.",2010,Feb 9,PLoS One,5,2,e9126,20161740,10.1371/journal.pone.0009126,,#6195,Becquart 2010,"",seroprevelance in humans

RESULTS: Ninety patients, with a positive test result, were hospitalized. Their mean age was 34.12+/-14.29 years and 63% were male patients. Most worked in the informal sector (38%) and in the medical and paramedical staff (physicians 12%, nurses 6%, and laboratory technicians 1%). Most patients lived in the Conakry suburbs (74%) and in Boffa (11%). The main clinical signs were physical asthenia (80%) and fever (72%). Hemorrhagic signs were observed in 26% of patients.

Among all persons with such contact in the family setting, those who provided nursing care had a 5.1-fold increased risk of infection, emphasizing the importance of intimate contact in the spread of this disease. The absence of illness among persons who were exposed to cases in confined spaces, but without physical contact, confirmed previous impressions that there is no risk of airborne transmission.

Spatiotemporal Analysis of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic in West Africa,"Backer, J.

To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas.

Glycoprotein (GP), an essential component of the EBOV genome, is highly variable and a potential site for the occurrence of advantageous mutations. For this study, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of EBOV by analyzing 65 GP sequences from humans and great apes over diverse locations across epidemic waves between 1976 and 2014.

"Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire, 1976","","Between 1 September and 24 October 1976, 318 cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Zaire. The outbreak was centred in the Bumba Zone of the Equateur Region and most of the cases were recorded within a radius of 70 km of Yambuku, although a few patients sought medical attention in Bumba, Abumombazi, and the capital city of Kinshasa, where individual secondary and tertiary cases occurred. There were 280 deaths, and only 38 serologically confirmed survivors.The index case in this outbreak had onset of symptoms on 1 September 1976, five days after receiving an injection of chloroquine for presumptive malaria at the outpatient clinic at Yambuku Mission Hospital (YMH). He had a clinical remission of his malaria symptoms. Within one week several other persons who had received injections at YMH also suffered from Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and almost all subsequent cases had either received injections at the hospital or had had close contact with another case. Most of these occurred during the first four weeks of the epidemic, after which time the hospital was closed, 11 of the 17 staff members having died of the disease. All ages and both sexes were affected, but women 15-29 years of age had the highest incidence of disease, a phenomenon strongly related to attendance at prenatal and outpatient clinics at the hospital where they received injections. The overall secondary attack rate was about 5%, although it ranged to 20% among close relatives such as spouses, parent or child, and brother or sister.Active surveillance disclosed that cases occurred in 55 of some 550 villages which were examined house-by-house. The disease was hitherto unknown to the people of the affected region. Intensive search for cases in the area of north-eastern Zaire between the Bumba Zone and the Sudan frontier near Nzara and Maridi failed to detect definite evidence of a link between an epidemic of the disease in that country and the outbreak near Bumba. Nevertheless it was established that people can and do make the trip between Nzara and Bumba in not more than four days: thus it was regarded as quite possible that an infected person had travelled from Sudan to Yambuku and transferred the virus to a needle of the hospital while receiving an injection at the outpatient clinic.Both the incubation period, and the duration of the clinical disease averaged about one week. After 3-4 days of non-specific symptoms and signs, patients typically experienced progressively severe sore throat, developed a maculopapular rash, had intractable abdominal pain, and began to bleed from multiple sites, principally the gastrointestinal tract. Although laboratory determinations were limited and not conclusive, it was concluded that pathogenesis of the disease included non-icteric hepatitis and possibly acute pancreatitis as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation.This syndrome was caused by a virus morphologically similar to Marburg virus, but immunologically distinct. It was named Ebola virus. The agent was isolated from the blood of 8 of 10 suspected cases using Vero cell cultures. Titrations of serial specimens obtained from one patient disclosed persistent viraemia of 10(6.5)-10(4.5) infectious units from the third day of illness until death on the eighth day. Ebola virus particles were found in formalin-",1978,,Bull World Health Organ,56,2,271-93,307456,,,#6470,,"",""

"A multi-regional epidemic model for controlling the spread of Ebola: awareness, treatment, and travel-blocking optimal control approaches","Zakary, Omar; Rachik, Mostafa; Elmouki, Ilias","Ebola virus disease (EVD) can rapidly cause death to animals and people, for less than 1 month. In addition, EVD can emerge in one region and spread to its neighbors in unprecedented durations. Such cases were reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Thus, by blocking free travelers, traders, and transporters, EVD has had also impacts on economies of those countries. In order to find effective strategies that aim to increase public knowledge about EVD and access to possible treatment while restricting movements of people coming from regions at high risk of infection, we analyze three different optimal control approaches associated with awareness campaigns, treatment, and travel-blocking operations that health policy-makers could follow in the war on EVD. Our study is based on the application of Pontryagin's maximum principle, in a multi-regional epidemic model we devise here for controlling the spread of EVD. The model is in the form of multi-differential systems that describe dynamics of susceptible, infected, and removed populations belonging to p different geographical domains with three control functions incorporated. The forward-backward sweep method with integrated progressive-regressive Runge-Kutta fourth-order schemes is followed for resolving the multi-points boundary value problems obtained.

Deciphering Dynamics of Recent Epidemic Spread and Outbreak in West Africa: The Case of Ebola Virus,"Upadhyay, Ranjit Kumar; Roy, Parimita","Recently, the 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was the largest outbreak to date. In this paper, an attempt has been made for modeling the virus dynamics using an SEIR model to better understand and characterize the transmission trajectories of the Ebola outbreak. We compare the simulated results with the most recent reported data of Ebola infected cases in the three most affected countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The epidemic model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria. Existence and local stability of these equilibria are explored. Using central manifold theory, it is established that the transcritical bifurcation occurs when basic reproduction number passes through unity. The proposed Ebola epidemic model provides an estimate to the potential number of future cases. The model indicates that the disease will decline after peaking if multisectorial and multinational efforts to control the spread of infection are maintained. Possible implication of the results for disease eradication and its control are discussed which suggests that proper control strategies like: (i) transmission precautions, (ii) isolation and care of infectious Ebola patients, (iii) safe burial, (iv) contact tracing with follow-up and quarantine, and (v) early diagnosis are needed to stop the recurrent outbreak.",2016,Aug,International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos,26,9,,WOS:000383881300003,10.1142/s021812741630024x,,#6905,Upadhyay 2016,"",""

EBOLA HEMORRHAGIC FEVER IN SUDAN 1976 REPORT OF A WHO INTERNATIONAL STUDY TEAM,"Who Int Study, Team","A large outbreak of hemorrhagic fever (subsequently named Ebola hemorrhagic fever) occurred in southern Sudan between June and Nov., 1976. There was a total of 284 cases, 67 in the source town of Nzara, 213 in Maridi, 3 in Tembura and 1 in Juba. The outbreak in Nzara appeared to originate in the workers of a cotton factory. The disease in Maridi was amplified by transmission in a large, active hospital. Transmission of the disease required close contact with an acute case and was usually associated with the act of nursing a patient. The incubation period was 7-14 days. Although the link was not well established, Nzara could have been the source of infection for a similar outbreak in the Bumba Zone of Zaire. In this outbreak Ebola hemorrhagic fever was a unique clinical disease with a high mortality rate (53% overall) and a prolonged recovery period in those who survived. Beginning with an influenza-like syndrome, including fever, headache and joint and muscle pains, the disease soon caused diarrhea (81%), vomiting (59%), chest pain (83%), pain and dryness of the throat (63%) and rash (52%). Hemorrhagic manifestations were common (71%), being present in half of the recovered cases and in almost all the fatal cases. Two post mortems were carried out on patients in Nov. 1976. The histopathological findings resembled those of an acute viral infection and although the features were characteristic they were not exclusively diagnostic. They closely resembled the features described in Marburg virus infection, with focal eosinophilic necrosis in the liver and destruction of lymphocytes and their replacement by plasma cells. One case had evidence of renal tubular necrosis. Two strains of Ebola virus were isolated from acute phase sera collected from acutely ill patients in Maridi hospital during the investigation in Nov. 1976. Antibodies to Ebola virus were detected by immunofluorescence in 42 of 48 patients in Maridi who were diagnosed clinically, but in only 6 of 31 patients in Nzara. The possibility of the indirect immunofluorescent test not being sufficiently sensitive is discussed. Of Maridi case contacts, in hospital and in the local community, 19% had antibodies. Very few of them gave any history of illness, indicating that Ebola virus can cause mild or even subclinical infections. Of the cloth room workers in the Nzara cotton factory, 37% appeared to have been infected, suggesting that the factory may have been the prime source of infection.",1978,1978,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,56,2,247-270,BCI:BCI197866067538,,,#7199,WhoIntStudy 1978,"",Useful; outbreak report
Assessing the impact of the environmental contamination on the transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD),"Tsanou, Berge; Bowong, Samuel; Lubuma, Jean; Mbang, Joseph","This paper deals with the following biological question: how influential is the environmental contamination on the transmission of EVD? Based on the works in (Bibby et al., Environ Sci Technol Lett 2:2-6, 2015; Leroy et al., Nature 438: 575-576, 2005; World Health Organization. Unprecedented number of medical staff infected with Ebola), we design a new mathematical model to address this question by assessing the effect of the Ebola virus contaminated environment on the dynamical transmission of EVD. The formulated model captures two infection pathways through both direct human-to-human transmission and indirect human-to-environment-to-human transmission by incorporating the environment as a transition and/or reservoir of Ebola viruses. We compute the basic reproduction number for the model with environmental contamination and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) whenever . When , we show that the said model has a unique endemic equilibrium which is GAS. Similar results hold for the free environmental contamination sub-model (without the incorporation of the indirect transmission). More precisely, for the latter model, calculate the corresponding basic reproduction number and establish the GAS of the disease-free and endemic equilibria, whenever and , respectively. At the endemic level, we show that the number of infected individuals for the full model with the environmental contamination is greater than the corresponding number for the free environmental contamination sub-model. In conjunction with the inequality , our finding suggests a negative answer to the biological question under investigation, i.e. the contaminated environment plays a detrimental role on the transmission dynamics of EVD by increasing the endemic level and/or the severity of the outbreak. Therefore, it is natural to implement a control strategy which aim at reducing the severity of the disease by providing adequate hygienic living conditions, educate populations at risk to follow rigorously those basic hygienic conditions as well as ask them avoid contact with suspected contaminated objects.

The obtained results, qualitatively and quantitatively, suggest that migration and contact rates play an important role in controlling the spreading of disease. Critical values for migration and contact rates are evaluated and it is revealed that if these rates go beyond their critical values, it leads to delay in the stabilization of the system. It is also found that primary reproductive number increases with increase in migration rate. Besides this, the approximate time required to attain stability of the disease model system is also determined.

"Mathematical Modelling, Simulation, and Optimal Control of the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa","Rachah, Amira; Torres, Delfim F. M.","The Ebola virus is currently one of the most virulent pathogens for humans. The latest major outbreak occurred in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia in 2014. With the aimof understanding the spread of infection in the affected countries, it is crucial to modelize the virus and simulate it. In this paper, we begin by studying a simple mathematical model that describes the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Then, we use numerical simulations and available data provided by the World Health Organization to validate the obtained mathematical model. Moreover, we develop a new mathematical model including vaccination of individuals. We discuss different cases of vaccination in order to predict the effect of vaccination on the infected individuals over time. Finally, we apply optimal control to study the impact of vaccination on the spread of the Ebola virus. The optimal control problem is solved numerically by using a direct multiple shooting method.",2015,2015,Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society,,,,WOS:000355470600001,10.1155/2015/842792,,#8735,Rachah 2015,"",""
Ebola in West Africa: Model-Based Exploration of Social Psychological Effects and Interventions,"Pruyt, Erik; Auping, Willem L.; Kwakkel, Jan H.","In the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, sociocultural, psychological and higher-order disease-related dynamics play an important role in the speed of virus transmission. Although such effects may strongly affect outbreaks, they are often not included in transmission models. Here, we include different combinations of these effects in an extended system dynamics transmission model to generate and explore ensembles of plausible future dynamics of the Ebola outbreak and test the effectiveness of sets of policies in the presence of these effects under deep uncertainty. Accounting for these effects, it seems that policies currently being implemented to curb the ongoing Ebola epidemic are, or could be made, sufficient to curb the epidemic by early 2015 unless psychological and sociocultural effects remain adverse.

"A Retrospective Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of the West African Ebola Epidemic, 2014-2015","Ord, Keith; Getis, Arthur","The goal is to predict the final extent of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, 2014-2015, well before its end. Our models are based on the nature of the reported data, and the social, medical, and technological conditions that existed in real time during the course of the epidemic. The spatial and temporal nature of Ebola transmission is considered. A modified, classical compartmental model is used to develop variations of Gompertz and logistic-type predictive models. A map analysis strongly hints at the existence of an initial rural component of the transmission of the disease followed by an urban component. Cumulative and weekly data for the three countries illustrate how the disease intensified and spread over the 90 weeks of the epidemic. A spatial autocorrelation study shows the clustering locational changes of the disease over time. A cross-correlation study gives credence to both a rural and an urban transmission pattern. Our early estimates of the toll of the disease, crude as they are, stand in marked contrast to some of the official estimates at the time, which greatly inflated the number of new cases.",2018,Oct,Geographical Analysis,50,4,337-357,WOS:000448171100001,10.1111/gean.12153,,#9153,Ord 2018,"",""
Modelling the potential impact of limited hospital beds on Ebola virus disease dynamics,"Njankou, Sylvie Diane Djiomba; Nyabadza, Farai","During the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak, admission into a health facility depended on the availability of hospital beds and health personnel. The limited number of such important logistics contributed to the escalation of the epidemic. We use a compartmental model to study the dynamics of Ebola virus disease when there is a limited number of beds for patients. We use a non-linear hospitalisation rate and formulate the rate at which the time-dependent number of available beds evolves. The model shows a backward bifurcation. Simulation results show that bed supply in Ebola treatment units contribute to the reduction of the number of individuals infected by Ebola virus. The model fitting results suggest that a timely supply of sufficient beds to Ebola treatment units limits the spread of the disease. Despite the fact that bed supplies to Ebola treatment units are not in themselves a control measure, they contribute to the reduction of the disease spread, by keeping the infectious in one place, during their infectious period. These results have important implications to the management and control of the disease.",2018,Dec,Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences,41,18,8528-8544,WOS:000452611500013,10.1002/mma.4789,,#9378,Njankou 2018,"",""
Analysis of bias in an Ebola epidemic model by extended Kalman filter approach,"Ndanguza, Denis; Mbalawata, Isambi S.; Haario, Heikki; Tchuenche, Jean M.","Ebola is a highly infectious disease generally characterized by sporadic outbreaks. A deterministic Ebola model is formulated and converted into Ito stochastic differential equations by adding noise on each compartment. In order to estimate the model parameter values, we use the extended Kalman filter technique as the filtering method and sum of square of errors to compute an approximation of the likelihood. From the obtained likelihood function, the maximum likelihood and MCMC methods for parameters estimation are then used. These parameter estimates provide useful information on quantities of epidemiological interest. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the model error covariance is set to be zero and (2) the bias is fully incorporated into the model. A comparison between these two cases is carried out to assess whether the bias is having a measure effect on parameters and states estimation. Finally, we investigate whether an estimate obtained from a biased study differs systematically from the true source population of the study. Our results indicate that the more the increase of bias, the more the noise in states simulation and parameters estimation compared to the deterministic model.

Policy makers must allocate limited intervention resources quickly, in anticipation of where the outbreak is moving next. We develop a two-stage model for optimizing when and where to assign Ebola treatment units across geographic regions during the outbreak's early phases. The first stage employs a novel dynamic transmission model to forecast the occurrence of new cases at the region level, capturing connectivity among regions. We introduce an empirically estimated coefficient for behavioral adaptation to changing epidemic conditions. The second stage compares four approaches to allocate units across affected regions: (i) a heuristic based on observed cases, (ii) a greedy policy that prioritizes regions based on the reproductive number, (iii) a myopic linear program that allocates resources in the next period based on an iterative estimation-optimization approach coupled with the underlying epidemic model, and (iv) an approximate dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes over all future periods. After testing the allocation schemes under different budgets and time periods, we find that the myopic policy performs best, even when limited data are available.

Study on modeling simulation and optimal control method for the transmission risk of the Ebola virus,"Liu, Shihao","In order to prevent and control the transmission risk of the Ebola virus, an Ebola virus disease SEIQR model was built. The free-Ebola-virus-disease equilibrium state and the Ebola-virus-disease equilibrium state of the SEIQR model are asymptotically stable. On the basis of the SEIQR model, the numerical simulation was formulated. From the simulation curves, it is found that if the production speed of the medicine cannot keep pace with demand, the transmission risk of Ebola will become out of control. Assuming that the medicine demand point and the medicine supply point constitute a logistics system in a certain planar range, the center-of-gravity method was used to obtain the optimal location for medicine delivery. By using this discrete-time virus model's optimal control rate to control the serious transmission risk of Ebola virus in the crowd, the effective strategy for transmission was added to the model, and then the control sheet was obtained.

Optimal control problem for a SEIR type model of ebola epidemics,"Grigorieva, Ellina V.; Deignan, Paul B.; Khailov, Evgenii N.","AbstractA Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) type control model describing the Ebola epidemic in a population of constant size is considered over a fixed time interval. This model is an extension of the well-known SEIR model and is more suitable to the study of the control mechanism of Ebola epidemics. Along with the traditional SEIR compartments, this model contains an isolated infectious compartment representing the number of infected and exposed individuals that have been isolated from the susceptible individuals. The model has two intervention controls reflecting efforts to protect susceptible individuals from infected and exposed individuals. Additionally, there are two control functions that define efforts for the detection and isolation of infected and exposed individuals. The minimization problem of the sum of total fractions of infected and exposed individuals and total weighted costs of control constraints over a given time interval is stated. For the analysis of the corresponding optimal controls, the Pontryagin maximum principle is used. Accordingly, the controls are bang-bang functions determined by the corresponding switching functions. In order to estimate the number of zeros of the switching functions, a new approach is proposed based on the analysis of the Cauchy problems for the derivatives of these functions. It is found that the optimal controls of the original problem have at most one switching. This allows the reduction of the original complex optimal control problem to the solution of a much simpler problem of conditional minimization of a function of three variables.

Viruses of each outbreak were isolated and the full-length genomes were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis was then undertaken to characterize the relationships with previously described viruses. Results. The 2 Luebo viruses are nearly identical but are not related to lineage A viruses known in DRC or to descendants of the lineage B viruses encountered in the Gabon-Republic of the Congo area, with which they do, however, share a common ancestor. Conclusions. Our findings strongly suggest that the Luebo 2007 outbreak did not result from viral spread from previously identified foci but from an independent viral emergence. The previously identified epidemiological link with migratory bat species known to carry Zaire ebolavirus RNA support the hypothesis of viral spillover from this widely dispersed reservoir.

Stability analysis of epidemic models of Ebola hemorrhagic fever with non-linear transmission,"Goufo, Emile Franc Doungmo; Pene, Morgan Kamga; Mugisha, Stella","Some Epidemic models with fractional derivatives were proved to be well-defined, well-posed and more accurate (Brockmann et al.

In this paper, an Ebola epidemic model with non linear transmission is analyzed. The model is expressed with the conventional time derivative with a new parameter included, which happens to be fractional. We proved that the model is well-defined, well-posed. Moreover, conditions for boundedness and dissipativity of the trajectories are established. Exploiting the generalized Routh-Hurwitz Criteria, existence and stability analysis of equilibrium points for Ebola model are performed to show that they are strongly dependent on the non-linear transmission. In particular, conditions for existence and stability of a unique endemic equilibrium to the Ebola system are given. Finally, numerical simulations are provided for particular expressions of the non-linear transmission (with parameters k = 0.01, k = 1 and p = 2). The obtained simulations are in concordance with the usual threshold behavior. The results obtained here are significant for the fight and prevention against Ebola haemorrhagic fever that has so far exterminated hundreds of families and is still infecting many people in West-Africa.

Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO), parameters within the model are fit to recent estimates of infected and deceased cases from each nation.

Finally, several metrics are proposed to determine which of these nations is in greatest need of additional resources to combat the spread of infection.

Bilevel Optimization Model for the Development of Real-Time Strategies to Minimize Epidemic Spreading Risk in Air Traffic Networks,"Chen, Nan; Gardner, Lauren; Rey, David","An understanding is needed of how epidemics spread to new regions via the global air traffic network so that effective strategies for outbreak control can be developed. Various studies have focused on predicting epidemic spread via the complex air traffic network. However, there is a gap in the literature demanding real-time predictive models that exploit the heterogeneous nature of the air travel pattern to optimize decision making among a set of potential control strategies. A bilevel optimization model is proposed to solve the resource allocation problem for an ongoing epidemic spreading via the air traffic network. The upper-level objective is to optimize the distribution of limited resources for epidemic control, and the lower-level simulation model computes the risk posed to the network under possible scenarios. Results from a demonstration network highlight the advantages of this model. A case study evaluates the risk posed by Ebola to the United States through the domestic air traffic network.

On a New Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic and Dead-Infective Subpopulations with Feedback Controls Useful for Ebola Disease,"De la Sen, M.; Ibeas, A.; Alonso-Quesada, S.; Nistal, R.","This paper studies the nonnegativity and local and global stability properties of the solutions of a newly proposed SEIADR model which incorporates asymptomatic and dead-infective subpopulations into the standard SEIR model and, in parallel, it incorporates feedback vaccination plus a constant term on the susceptible and feedback antiviral treatment controls on the symptomatic infectious subpopulation. A third control action of impulsive type (or ""culling"") consists of the periodic retirement of all or a fraction of the lying corpses which can become infective in certain diseases, for instance, the Ebola infection. The three controls are allowed to be eventually time varying and contain a total of four design control gains. The local stability analysis around both the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points is performed by the investigation of the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrices. The global stability is formally discussed by using tools of qualitative theory of differential equations by using Gauss-Stokes and Bendixson theorems so that neither Lyapunov equation candidates nor the explicit solutions are used. It is proved that stability holds as a parallel property to positivity and that disease-free and the endemic equilibrium states cannot be simultaneously either stable or unstable. The periodic limit solution trajectories and equilibrium points are analyzed in a combined fashion in the sense that the endemic periodic solutions become, in particular, equilibrium points if the control gains converge to constant values and the control gain for culling the infective corpses is asymptotically zeroed.",2017,2017,Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society,,,,WOS:000396247900001,10.1155/2017/4232971,,#13681,DelaSen 2017,"",""

A new epidemics-logistics model: Insights into controlling the Ebola virus disease in West Africa,"Buyuktahtakm, I. Esra; des-Bordes, Emmanuel; Kibis, Eyyub Y.","Compartmental models have been a phenomenon of studying epidemics. However, existing compartmental models do not explicitly consider the spatial spread of an epidemic and logistics issues simultaneously. In this study, we address this limitation by introducing a new epidemics-logistics mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that determines the optimal amount, timing and location of resources that are allocated for controlling an infectious disease outbreak while accounting for its spatial spread dynamics. The objective of this proposed model is to minimize the total number of infections and fatalities under a limited budget over a multi-period planning horizon. The present study is the first spatially explicit optimization approach that considers geographically varying rates for disease transmission, migration of infected individuals over different regions, and varying treatment rates due to the limited capacity of treatment centers. We illustrate the performance of the MIP model using the case of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Our results provide explicit information on intervention timing and intensity for each specific region of these most affected countries. Our model predictions closely fit the real outbreak data and suggest that large upfront investments in treatment and isolation result in the most efficient use of resources to minimize infections. The proposed modeling framework can be adopted to study other infectious diseases and provide tangible policy recommendations for controlling an infectious disease outbreak over large spatial and temporal scales.

Hence, prevention, control measures and supportive treatment remain the only means to avoid the disease. Among these measures, contact tracing occupies a prominent place. In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical model that incorporates imperfect contact tracing, quarantine and hospitalization (or isolation). The control reproduction number R-c of each sub-model and for the full model are computed. Theoretically, we prove that when R-c is less than one, the corresponding model has a unique globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium. Conversely, when R-c is greater than one, the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and a unique globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium arises. Furthermore, we numerically support the analytical results and assess the efficiency of different control strategies. Our main observation is that, to eradicate EVD, the combination of high contact tracing (up to 90%) and effective isolation is better than all other control measures, namely: (1) perfect contact tracing, (2) effective isolation or full hospitalization, (3) combination of medium contact tracing and medium isolation.",2018,Oct,International Journal of Biomathematics,11,7,,WOS:000448009900010,10.1142/s1793524518500936,,#15136,Berge 2018,Dariya Nikitin (2023-08-09 20:05:58)(Included): paywall; Juliette Unwin (2019-06-26 18:07:27)(Select): Can't find; ,Can't find
Dynamics of host-reservoir transmission of Ebola with spillover potential to humans,"Berge, Tsanou; Lubuma, Jean; Tasse, Arsene Jaures Ouemba; Tenkam, Herve Michel","Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a zoonotic disease (i.e. disease that is spread from animals to people). Therefore human beings can be infected through direct contact with an infected animal (fruit-eating bat or great ape). It has been demonstrated that fruit-eating bats of pteropodidae family are potential reservoir of EVD. Moreover, it has been biologically shown that fruit-eating bats do not die due to EVD and bear the Ebola viruses lifelong. We develop in this paper, a mathematical model to assess the impact of the reservoir on the dynamics of EVD. Our model couples a bat-to-bat model with a human-to-human model and the indirect environmental contamination through a spillover process (i.e. process by which a zoonotic pathogen moves (regardless of transmission mode) from an animal host (or environmental reservoir) to a human host) from bats to humans. The sub-models and the coupled models exhibit each a threshold behavior with the corresponding basic reproduction numbers being the bifurcation parameters. Existence of equilibria, their global stability are established by combining monotone operator theory, Lyapunov-LaSalle techniques and graph theory. Control strategies are assessed by using the target reproduction numbers. The efforts required to control EVD are assessed as well through S-control. The spillover event is shown to be highly detrimental to EVD by allowing the disease to switch from bats to humans even though the disease was not initially endemic in the human population. Precisely, we show that the spillover phenomenon contributes to speed up the disease outbreak. This suggests that the manipulation and consumption of fruit-bats play an important role in sustaining EVD in a given environment.",2018,2018,Electronic Journal of Qualitative Theory of Differential Equations,,14,1-32,WOS:000430311500001,10.14232/ejqtde.2018.1.14,,#15138,Berge 2018,Juliette Unwin (2019-08-02 17:32:00)(Select): both bat and human model; ,Spillover

In the latter case, the model system admits at least one endemic equilibrium point, which is locally asymptotically stable. Using the parameters relevant to the transmission dynamics of the Ebola virus disease, we give sensitivity analysis of the model. We show that the number of infectious individuals is much smaller than that obtained in the absence of any intervention.

Optimal Control Design of Impulsive SQEIAR Epidemic Models with Application to COVID-19,"Abbasi, Z.; Zamani, I.; Mehra, A. H.

The goal of this paper is to reduce the size of susceptible, infected, exposed and asymptomatic groups to consequently eradicate the infection by using two actions: the quarantine and the treatment of infected people. To reach this purpose, optimal control theory is presented to control the epidemic model over free terminal optimal time control with an optimal cost. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimal final time. Also, an impulsive epidemic model of SQEIAR is considered to deal with the potential suddenly increased in population caused by immigration or travel. Since this model is suitable to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, especial attention is devoted to this case. Thus, numerical simulations are given to prove the accuracy of the theoretical claims and applied to the particular data of this infection.

Hence, in this study, we presented a novel and feasible human-bat (host-vector) ShEhIhRhisRhni - SbEbIb model which foretells the spread and severity of the Ebola virus from bats to humans to investigate the combined effects of three control strategies viz: (1) allowing specialized and designated agencies to bury deceased from Ebola infection without relatives touching or curdling the remains as usually practiced in most part of Africa as last respect for their departed love ones ( k1 ), (2) systematic and deliberate depopulation of bats in the metropolis (through persecution with pesticide exposure, pre capturing, chemical timber treatment for roosts destruction) to discourage hunting them for food by virtue of their proximity ( k2 ) and (3) immediate treatment of infected individuals in isolation ( k3 ). We established, among others, the endemic equilibrium, disease-free equilibrium, global and local stability, non-negativity, and boundedness of the model to prove the epidemiological feasibility of the model. The reality of the presence of optimal control remarkably influences the dynamics of transmission of the virus and simulated results also confirm the great effect of the combination of the control strategies k1 , k2 and k3 in flattening the curve of Ebola transmission (fig 1 - fig 8).

"Analyzing and forecasting the Ebola incidence in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2018-19 in real time","Akhmetzhanov, A. R.; Lee, H.; Jung, S. M.; Kayano, T.; Yuan, B.; Nishiura, H.","During an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, the analysis and forecasting of the incidence in real time is challenged by reporting of cases, especially the reporting delay. It should be remembered that the latest count of cases is likely underestimated in real time, and moreover, the effective reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case at a given point in time, is also underestimated without proper adjustment. The present study aimed to adjust the reporting delay to appropriately estimate the latest incidence and obtain short-term forecasts from weekly reporting data of EVD in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A semi-structured modeling approach was taken, accounting for reporting delay which can depend on time. The mean reporting delay was estimated at 11.6 days (95% CI: 11.3, 11.9) and the standard deviation was estimated to have changed from 26 November 2019 from 8.5-6.0 days. Nowcasting was successfully implemented by account for the time-dependent reporting delay: it mostly contained future observed values within the 95% confidence intervals, but there were failures when the reported incidence abruptly changed over time. Forecasting was also exercised in a similar manner to the nowcasting, while we imposed an extrapolation approach to the effective reproduction number for two future weeks. Moving average of the reproduction numbers for a few weeks prior the latest time of observation outperformed other extrapolations. The information that we can gain from real time (i.e. sequential) update of ""situation report"" can be considerably improved by integrating the proposed nowcasting and forecasting to the surveillance system.",2019,Jun,Epidemics,27,,123-131,31080016,10.1016/j.epidem.2019.05.002,,#15388,Akhmetzhanov 2019,"Rebecca Nash (2023-08-12 01:02:17)(Select): Reporting delay, reproduction number; ",""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between vitamin A supplementation and mortality in EVD. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included patients with EVD admitted to 5 International Medical Corps Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in 2 countries during 2014-2015. Protocolized treatments with micronutrients were used at all ETUs: however, because of resource constraints, only a subset of patients received vitamin A. Standardized data on demographics, clinical characteristics, malaria status, and Ebola viral loads (cycle threshold values) were collected. The outcome of interest was mortality between cases treated with 200,000 IU of vitamin A on care days 1 and/or 2, and those not. Propensity scores based on the first 48 h of care were derived using covariates of age, ETU duration, malaria status, cycle threshold values, and clinical symptoms. Patients were matched 1:1 using nearest neighbors with replacement. Mortality between cases treated and not treated with vitamin A was compared using generalized estimating equations to calculate RR with associated 95% CI. RESULTS: There were 424 cases analyzed, of which 330 (77.8%) were treated with vitamin A. The mean age was 30.5 y and 40.3% were men. The most common symptoms were diarrhea (85.6%), anorexia (80.7%), and abdominal pain (76.9%). Mortality proportions among cases treated and not treated with vitamin A were 55.0% and 71.9%, respectively. In the propensity-matched analysis, mortality was significantly lower among cases receiving vitamin A (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.99; P = 0.041).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female respondents from the 2019-2020 Liberia Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis covered 11 928 (women=7854 and men=4074) respondents for whom complete data were available. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome variable was the death of a household member or relative during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, coded 1 if the respondent reported death and 0 otherwise. METHODS: We applied the Bayesian geoadditive semiparametric regression to examine the extent of geospatial clustering of deaths at the district-level and community-level development and socioeconomic factors associated with the observed clustering. RESULTS: Almost a quarter (24.8%) of all respondents reported the death of a household member or relative during the Ebola outbreak. The results show that deaths were clustered within districts in six (Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, Monsterrado, Margibi, Gbarpolu and Lofa) of the 15 counties in Liberia. Districts with high death clustering were all near or shared borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea. The community-level development indicators (global human footprint, gross cell production and population density) had a non-linear associative effect with the observed spatial clustering. Also, respondents' characteristics (respondent's age (non-linear effect), educational attainment and urban-rural place of residence) were associated with the observed clustering. The results show that death clustering during outbreaks was constrained to poor settings and impacts areas of moderate and high socioeconomic development.

Targeted preventive vaccination campaigns to reduce Ebola outbreaks: An individual-based modeling study,"Bisanzio, D.; Davis, A. E.; Talbird, S. E.; Van Effelterre, T.; Metz, L.; Gaudig, M.; Mathieu, V. O.; Brogan, A. J.","INTRODUCTION: Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and ring vaccination (i.e., vaccination that primarily targets contacts and contacts of contacts of Ebola cases) are currently used to reduce the spread of Ebola during outbreaks. Because these measures are typically initiated after an outbreak is declared, they are limited by real-time implementation challenges. Preventive vaccination may provide a complementary option to help protect communities against unpredictable outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the impact of preventive vaccination strategies when implemented in conjunction with NPI and ring vaccination. METHODS: A spatial-explicit, individual-based model (IBM) that accounts for heterogeneity of human contact, human movement, and timing of interventions was built to represent Ebola transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simulated preventive vaccination strategies targeted healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FW), and the general population (GP) with varying levels of coverage (lower coverage: 30% of HCW/FW, 5% of GP; higher coverage: 60% of HCW/FW, 10% of GP) and efficacy (lower efficacy: 60%; higher efficacy: 90%). RESULTS: The IBM estimated that the addition of preventive vaccination for HCW reduced cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by ∼11 % to ∼25 % compared with NPI + ring vaccination alone. Including HCW and FW in the preventive vaccination campaign yielded ∼14 % to ∼38 % improvements in epidemic outcomes. Further including the GP yielded the greatest improvements, with ∼21 % to ∼52 % reductions in epidemic outcomes compared with NPI + ring vaccination alone. In a scenario without ring vaccination, preventive vaccination reduced cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by ∼28 % to ∼59 % compared with NPI alone. In all scenarios, preventive vaccination reduced Ebola transmission particularly during the initial phases of the epidemic, resulting in flatter epidemic curves. CONCLUSIONS: The IBM showed that preventive vaccination may reduce Ebola cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, thus safeguarding the healthcare system and providing more time to implement additional interventions during an outbreak.",2023,Jan 16,Vaccine,41,3,684-693,36526505,10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.036,,#15673,Bisanzio 2023,"",""
"Predicting the combined effects of case isolation, safe funeral practices, and contact tracing during Ebola virus disease outbreaks","Bouba, A.; Helle, K. B.; Schneider, K. A.","BACKGROUND: The recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Uganda and the Marburg virus disease (MVD) in Ghana reflect a persisting threat of Filoviridae to the global health community. Characteristic of Filoviridae are not just their high case fatality rates, but also that corpses are highly contagious and prone to cause infections in the absence of appropriate precautions. Vaccines against the most virulent Ebolavirus species, the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) are approved. However, there exists no approved vaccine or treatment against the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) which causes the current outbreak of EVD. Hence, the control of the outbreak relies on case isolation, safe funeral practices, and contact tracing. So far, the effectiveness of these control measures was studied only separately by epidemiological models, while the impact of their interaction is unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To sustain decision making in public health-emergency management, we introduce a predictive model to study the interaction of case isolation, safe funeral practices, and contact tracing. The model is a complex extension of an SEIR-type model, and serves as an epidemic preparedness tool. The model considers different phases of the EVD infections, the possibility of infections being treated in isolation (if appropriately diagnosed), in hospital (if not properly diagnosed), or at home (if the infected do not present to hospital for whatever reason). It is assumed that the corpses of those who died in isolation are buried with proper safety measures, while those who die outside isolation might be buried unsafely, such that transmission can occur during the funeral. Furthermore, the contacts of individuals in isolation will be traced. Based on parameter estimates from the scientific literature, the model suggests that proper diagnosis and hence isolation of cases has the highest impact in reducing the size of the outbreak. However, the combination of case isolation and safe funeral practices alone are insufficient to fully contain the epidemic under plausible parameters. This changes if these measures are combined with contact tracing. In addition, shortening the time to successfully trace back contacts contribute substantially to contain the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of an approved vaccine and treatment, EVD management by proper and fast diagnostics in combination with epidemic awareness are fundamental. Awareness will particularly facilitate contact tracing and safe funeral practices. Moreover, proper and fast diagnostics are a major determinant of case isolation. The model introduced here is not just applicable to EVD, but also to other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as the MVD or the Lassa fever.",2023,,PLoS One,18,1,e0276351,36649296,10.1371/journal.pone.0276351,,#15735,Bouba 2023,"Juliette Unwin (2023-08-11 21:56:14)(Select): model

Though EBOV is capable of causing severe disease, referred to as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), individuals who have never been diagnosed with confirmed, probable or suspected EVD can have detectable EBOV antigen-specific antibodies in their blood. This study aims to identify risk factors associated with detectable antibody levels in the absence of an EVD diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: Data was collected from September 2015 to August 2017 from 1,366 consenting individuals across four study sites in the DRC (Boende, Kabondo-Dianda, Kikwit, and Yambuku). Seroreactivity was determined to EBOV GP IgG using Zaire Ebola Virus Glycoprotein (EBOV GP antigen) ELISA kits (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc.) in Kinshasa, DRC; any result above 4.7 units/mL was considered seroreactive. Among the respondents, 113 (8.3%) were considered seroreactive. Several zoonotic exposures were associated with EBOV seroreactivity after controlling for age, sex, healthcare worker status, location, and history of contact with an EVD case, namely: ever having contact with bats, ever having contact with rodents, and ever eating non-human primate meat. Contact with monkeys or non-human primates was not associated with seroreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that some zoonotic exposures that have been linked to EVD outbreaks can also be associated with EBOV GP seroreactivity in the absence of diagnosed EVD.

Analysis of War and Conflict Effect on the Transmission Dynamics of the Tenth Ebola Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"Chapwanya, M.; Lubuma, J.; Terefe, Y.; Tsanou, B.","The tenth Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that occurred from 2018 to 2020 was exacerbated by long-lasting conflicts and war in the region. We propose a deterministic model to investigate the impact of such disruptive events on the transmission dynamics of the Ebola virus disease. It is an extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, enriched by an additional class of contaminated environment to account for indirect transmission as well as two classes of hospitalized individuals and patients who escape from the healthcare facility due to violence and attacks perpetrated by armed groups, rebels, etc. The model is formulated using two patches, namely Patch 1 consisting of the three affected eastern provinces in DRC and Patch 2, a war- and conflict-free area consisting of the go-to neighboring provinces for escaped patients. We introduce two key parameters, the escaping rate from hospitals and the destruction of hospitals, in terms of which the effect of war and conflicts is measured. The model is fitted and parameterized using the cumulative mortality data from the region. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is computed and found to have a complex expression due to the high nonlinearity of the model. By using, not a Lyapunov function, but a decomposition theorem in Castillo-Chavez et al.(in Castillo-Chavez et al. (eds) Mathematical approaches for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases: an introduction, vol 126. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Berlin, 2002), it is shown that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] and unstable when [Formula: see text]. A nonstandard finite difference scheme which replicates the dynamics of the continuous model is designed. In particular, a discrete counterpart of the above-mentioned theorem on the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium is investigated. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results. When [Formula: see text], the numerical simulations suggest that there exists for the full model a unique globally asymptotically stable interior endemic equilibrium point, while it is shown theoretically and computationally that the model possesses at least a one Patch 1 and a one Patch 2 boundary equilibria (i.e., Patch 2 and Patch 1 disease-free equilibrium) points, which are locally asymptotically stable.

A hybrid simulation model to study the impact of combined interventions on Ebola epidemic,"Chen, P.; Fan, W.; Guo, X.","Pandemics have been recognized as a serious global threat to humanity. To effectively prevent the spread and outbreak of the epidemic disease, theoretical models intended to depict the disease dynamics have served as the main tools to understand its underlying mechanisms and thus interrupt its transmission. Two commonly-used models are mean-field compartmental models and agent-based models (ABM). The former ones are analytically tractable for describing the dynamics of subpopulations by cannot explicitly consider the details of individual movements. The latter one is mainly used to the spread of epidemics at a microscopic level but have limited simulation scale for the randomness of the results. To overcome current limitations, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method, combining mean-field compartmental model and ABM, is proposed in this paper. Based on this method, we build a hybrid model, which takes both individual heterogeneity and the dynamics of sub-populations into account. The proposed model also investigates the impact of combined interventions (i. e. vaccination and pre-deployment training) for healthcare workers (HCWs) on the spread of disease. Taking the case of 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Sierra Leone as an example, we examine its spreading mechanism and evaluate the effect of prevention by our parameterized and validated hybrid model. According to our simulation results, an optimal combination of pre-job training and vaccination deployment strategy has been identified. To conclude, our hybrid model helps informing the synergistic disease control strategies and the corresponding hierarchical hybrid modeling and simulation method can further be used to understand the individual dynamics during epidemic spreading in large scale population and help inform disease control strategies for different infectious disease.",2021,,PLoS One,16,7,e0254044,34228758,10.1371/journal.pone.0254044,,#15924,Chen 2021,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-10 21:39:18)(Select): model; ,""

A novel sub-epidemic modeling framework for short-term forecasting epidemic waves,"Chowell, G.; Tariq, A.; Hyman, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Simple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. METHODS: We develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics. RESULTS: The sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.",2019,Aug 22,BMC Med,17,1,164,31438953,10.1186/s12916-019-1406-6,,#15958,Chowell 2019,Christian Morgenstern (2023-08-10 23:56:25)(Select): This is a growth rate model & we do capture growth rates in the parameters.

Vaccination strategies to control Ebola epidemics in the context of variable household inaccessibility levels,"Chowell, G.; Tariq, A.; Kiskowski, M.","Despite a very effective vaccine, active conflict and community distrust during the ongoing DRC Ebola epidemic are undermining control efforts, including a ring vaccination strategy that requires the prompt immunization of close contacts of infected individuals. However, in April 2019, it was reported 20% or more of close contacts cannot be reached or refuse vaccination, and it is predicted that the ring vaccination strategy would not be effective with such a high level of inaccessibility. The vaccination strategy is now incorporating a ""third ring"" community-level vaccination that targets members of communities even if they are not known contacts of Ebola cases. To assess the impact of vaccination strategies for controlling Ebola epidemics in the context of variable levels of community accessibility, we employed an individual-level stochastic transmission model that incorporates four sources of heterogeneity: a proportion of the population is inaccessible for contact tracing and vaccination due to lack of confidence in interventions or geographic inaccessibility, two levels of population mixing resembling household and community transmission, two types of vaccine doses with different time periods until immunity, and transmission rates that depend on spatial distance. Our results indicate that a ring vaccination strategy alone would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and affirm the positive impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. Our key results are that as levels of inaccessibility increase, there is a qualitative change in the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy. For higher levels of vaccine access, the probability that the epidemic will end steadily increases over time, even if probabilities are lower than they would be otherwise with full community participation. For levels of vaccine access that are too low, however, the vaccination strategies are not expected to be successful in ending the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, and makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. This qualitative change occurs for both types of vaccination strategies: ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10% in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50%. More broadly, our results underscore the need to enhance community engagement to public health interventions in order to enhance the effectiveness of control interventions to ensure outbreak containment.",2019,Nov,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,13,11,e0007814,31751337,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007814,,#15959,Chowell 2019,"Juliette Unwin (2023-08-11 19:03:20)(Select): vaccination model

Likewise, few studies, with very small sample sizes, have investigated cross-reactions between Ebolavirus spp. In this study, we aimed to assess the humoral antibody response and its determinants in survivors of EVD and assess cross-reactivity of antibodies between diverse Ebolavirus spp. METHODS: In this observational, prospective cohort study, we collected blood samples from patients from three recruitment sites in Guinea included in the Postebogui study, and we assessed IgG antibody binding to recombinant glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and 40-kDa viral protein (VP40) of Zaire (EBOV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Sudan (SUDV) Ebolaviruses. Participants from the PostEbogui study, from whom we had at least one blood sample that could be tested for the presence of antibodies, were eligible for this analysis. Patients in the PostEbogui study were assessed clinically at inclusion, 1 month and 3 months later, and subsequently every 6 months for up to 60 months after discharge from the Ebola treatment centre. We explored predictors of glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and VP40 antibody concentrations through a linear mixed model. A logistic mixed model was done to estimate the probability of seropositivity and associated determinants. We assessed cross-reactivity by use of hierarchical cluster analysis. FINDINGS: Of the 802 patients included in the Postebogui study, 687 were included in our analyses. 310 (45%) patients were men and 377 (55%) were women, with an overall median age at the time of the first blood sample of 27·3 years (IQR 19·5-38·2). We observed an overall significant decrease over time of EBOV antibodies, with antibodies against nucleoproteins decreasing more rapidly. At 60 months after discharge from the Ebola treatment centre, the probability of having antibodies against glycoproteins was 76·2% (95% CI 67·2-83·3), against nucleoproteins was 59·4% (46·3-71·3), and against VP40 was 60·9% (51·4-69·8). Persistence of EBOV RNA in semen was associated with higher concentrations of IgG antibodies against nucleoprotein EBOV antigens. Individually, we observed in some survivors an antibody wax-and-wane pattern. The proportion of cross-reactions was highest between glycoproteins from Kissidougou and Mayinga EBOV strains (94·5%, 95% CI 92·5-96·1), followed by EBOV VP40 and BDBV VP40 (88·3%, 85·7-90·6), and EBOV VP40 and SUDV VP40 (83·3%, 80·3-86·1). INTERPRETATION: The probability for survivors of EVD to have antibodies against one or more EBOV antigens remained high, although approximately 25% of survivors had undetectable antibodies, which could have implications, such as a possible decreasing population immunity, for future Ebola outbreaks in the same region.

A Quantitative Framework for Defining the End of an Infectious Disease Outbreak: Application to Ebola Virus Disease,"Djaafara, B. A.; Imai, N.; Hamblion, E.; Impouma, B.; Donnelly, C.

Objective estimation of the confidence level that an outbreak is over is important to reduce the risk of postdeclaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model with which to quantify that confidence and tested it on simulated Ebola virus disease data. We found that these confidence estimates were most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the time between the symptom onset and death or recovery of the last detected case. For Ebola virus disease, our results suggested that the current World Health Organization criterion of 42 days since the recovery or death of the last detected case is too short and too sensitive to underreporting. Therefore, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This preliminary declaration should still be followed by 90 days of enhanced surveillance to capture potential flare-ups of cases, after which the official end of the outbreak can be declared. This sequence corresponds to more than 95% confidence that an outbreak is over in most of the scenarios examined.

Modelling the Role of Human Behaviour in Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) Transmission Dynamics,"Djiomba Njankou, S.

A clear understanding of how human behaviour influences the spread of infectious diseases is critical in establishing and designing control measures. To study the role that human behaviour plays in Ebola disease dynamics, in this paper, we design an Ebola virus disease model with disease transmission dynamics based on a new exponential nonlinear incidence function. This new incidence function that captures the reduction in disease transmission due to human behaviour innovatively considers the efficacy and the speed of behaviour change. The model's steady states are determined and suitable Lyapunov functions are built. The proofs of the global stability of equilibrium points are presented. To demonstrate the utility of the model, we fit the model to Ebola virus disease data from Liberia and Sierra Leone. The results which are comparable to existing findings from the outbreak of 2014 - 2016 show a better fit when the efficacy and the speed of behaviour change are higher. A rapid and efficacious behaviour change as a control measure to rapidly control an Ebola virus disease epidemic is advocated.

Modelling the potential influence of human migration and two strains on Ebola virus disease dynamics,"Djiomba Njankou, S. D.; Nyabadza, F.","Migration of infected animals and humans, and mutation are considered as the source of the introduction of new pathogens and strains into a country. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model of Ebola virus disease dynamics, that describes the introduction of a new strain of ebolavirus, through either mutation or immigration (which can be continuous or impulsive) of infectives. The mathematical analysis of the model shows that when the immigration of infectives is continuous, the new strain invades a country if its invasion reproduction number is greater than one. When the immigration is impulsive, a newly introduced strain is controllable when its reproduction number is less than the ratio of mortality to the population inflow and only locally stable equilibria exist. This ratio is one if the population size is constant. In case of mutation of the resident strain of ebolavirus, the coexistence of the resident and mutated strains is possible at least if their respective reproduction numbers are greater than one. Results indicate that the competition for the susceptible population is the immediate consequence of the coexistence of two different strains of ebolavirus in a country and this competition is favourable to the most infectious strain. Results also indicate that impulsive immigration of infectives when compared with continuous immigration of infectives gives time for the implementation of control measures.

METHODS: We conducted a serosurvey among HCW in Boende, Tshuapa Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. Human anti-EBOV glycoprotein IgG titers were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit. We assessed associations between anti-EBOV IgG seroreactivity, defined as ≥2.5 units/mL, and risk factors using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses explored a more conservative cutoff, >5 units/mL. RESULTS: Overall, 22.5% of HCWs were seroreactive for EBOV. In multivariable analyses, using any form of personal protective equipment when interacting with a confirmed, probable, or suspect EVD case was negatively associated with seroreactivity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, .07-.73).

The ability of single genes vs full genomes to resolve time and space in outbreak analysis,"Dudas, G.; Bedford, T.","BACKGROUND: Inexpensive pathogen genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics, where ever increasing volumes of data have promised real-time insight into outbreaks of infectious disease. As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. RESULTS: In this study we highlighted the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (≈19 kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ≈2 kb long) gene. We have quantified changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compared these to theoretical expectations.

The data collected have provided more insight into the case fatality ratio (CFR) and how it varies with age and other characteristics. However, the accuracy and precision of the naive CFR remain limited because 44% of survival outcomes were unreported. METHODS: Using a boosted regression tree model, we imputed survival outcomes (ie, survival or death) when unreported, corrected for model imperfection to estimate the CFR without imputation, with imputation, and adjusted with imputation. The method allowed us to further identify and explore relevant clinical and demographic predictors of the CFR. RESULTS: The out-of-sample performance (95% confidence interval [CI]) of our model was good: sensitivity, 69.7% (52.5-75.6%); specificity, 69.8% (54.1-75.6%); percentage correctly classified, 69.9% (53.7-75.5%); and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 76.0% (56.8-82.1%).

METHODS: We used serostatus and self-reported postexposure symptoms from a cohort study to classify contact-participants as having no infection, paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or unrecognized EVD. Exposure risk was categorized as low, intermediate, or high. We created hypothetical scenarios to evaluate the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition with or without rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) or exposure assessments. RESULTS: This analysis included 990 EVD survivors and 1909 contacts, of whom 115 (6%) had paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic EBOV infection, 107 (6%) had unrecognized EVD, and 1687 (88%) were uninfected. High-risk exposures were drivers of unrecognized EVD (adjusted odds ratio, 3.5 [95% confidence interval, 2.4-4.9]). To identify contacts with unrecognized EVD who test negative by the WHO case definition, the sensitivity was 96% with RDT (95% confidence interval, 91%-99%), 87% with high-risk exposure (82%-92%), and 97% with intermediate- to high-risk exposures (93%-99%). The proportion of false-positives was 2% with RDT and 53%-93% with intermediate- and/or high-risk exposures.

Adequacy of SEIR models when epidemics have spatial structure: Ebola in Sierra Leone,"Getz, W. M.; Salter, R.; Mgbara, W.","Dynamic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) compartmental models provide a tool for predicting the size and duration of both unfettered and managed outbreaks-the latter in the context of interventions such as case detection, patient isolation, vaccination and treatment. The reliability of this tool depends on the validity of key assumptions that include homogeneity of individuals and spatio-temporal homogeneity. Although the SEIR compartmental framework can easily be extended to include demographic (e.g. age) and additional disease (e.g. healthcare workers) classes, dependence of transmission rates on time, and metapopulation structure, fitting such extended models is hampered by both a proliferation of free parameters and insufficient or inappropriate data. This raises the question of how effective a tool the basic SEIR framework may actually be. We go some way here to answering this question in the context of the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa by comparing fits of an SEIR time-dependent transmission model to both country- and district-level weekly incidence data. Our novel approach in estimating the effective-size-of-the-populations-at-risk ( N(eff)) and initial number of exposed individuals ( E(0)) at both district and country levels, as well as the transmission function parameters, including a time-to-halving-the-force-of-infection ( t(f/2)) parameter, provides new insights into this Ebola outbreak. It reveals that the estimate R(0) ≈ 1.7 from country-level data appears to seriously underestimate R(0) ≈ 3.3 - 4.3 obtained from more spatially homogeneous district-level data. Country-level data also overestimate t(f/2) ≈ 22 weeks, compared with 8-10 weeks from district-level data. Additionally, estimates for the duration of individual infectiousness is around two weeks from spatially inhomogeneous country-level data compared with 2.4-4.5 weeks from spatially more homogeneous district-level data, which estimates are rather high compared with most values reported in the literature.

Data suggest the outbreak is not epidemiologically linked to the 2018 outbreak in Equateur Province, and that independent introduction of Ebola virus (EBOV) into humans occurred. We tested for antibodies to ebolaviruses in febrile patients seeking care in North Kivu Province prior to the EVD outbreak. METHODS: Patients were enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018, before the declared start of the outbreak in eastern DRC. Questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and behavioural information to identify risk factors for exposure. Biological samples were evaluated for ebolavirus nucleic acid, and for antibodies to ebolaviruses. Prevalence of exposure was calculated, and demographic factors evaluated for associations with ebolavirus serostatus. RESULTS: Samples were collected and tested from 272 people seeking care in the Rutshuru Health Zone in North Kivu Province. All patients were negative for filoviruses by PCR. Intial screening by indirect ELISA found that 30 people were reactive to EBOV-rGP. Results were supported by detection of ebolavirus reactive linear peptides using the Serochip platform. Differential screening of all reactive serum samples against the rGP of all six ebolaviruses and Marburg virus (MARV) showed that 29 people exhibited the strongest reactivity to EBOV and one to Bombali virus (BOMV), and western blotting confirmed results. Titers ranged from 1:100 to 1:12,800. Although both sexes and all ages tested positive for antibodies, women were significantly more likely to be positive and the majority of positives were in February 2018. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first documented evidence of exposure to Ebola virus in people in eastern DRC. We detected antibodies to EBOV in 10% of febrile patients seeking healthcare prior to the declaration of the 2018-2020 outbreak, suggesting early cases may have been missed or exposure ocurred without associated illness. We also report the first known detection of antibodies to BOMV, previously detected in bats in West and East Africa, and show that human exposure to BOMV has occurred.

Inferring the reproduction number using the renewal equation in heterogeneous epidemics,"Green, W.; Ferguson, N.; Cori, A.","Real-time estimation of the reproduction number has become the focus of modelling groups around the world as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic unfolds. One of the most widely adopted means of inference of the reproduction number is via the renewal equation, which uses the incidence of infection and the generation time distribution. In this paper, we derive a multi-type equivalent to the renewal equation to estimate a reproduction number which accounts for heterogeneity in transmissibility including through asymptomatic transmission, symptomatic isolation and vaccination. We demonstrate how use of the renewal equation that misses these heterogeneities can result in biased estimates of the reproduction number. While the bias is small with symptomatic isolation, it can be much larger with asymptomatic transmission or transmission from vaccinated individuals if these groups exhibit substantially different generation time distributions to unvaccinated symptomatic transmitters, whose generation time distribution is often well defined. The bias in estimate becomes larger with greater population size or transmissibility of the poorly characterized group.

Using nationally representative household survey data on whether respondents knew a close friend or family member with Ebola, we explore the SES determinants of EVD exposure along individual, household, and community lines in Liberia and Sierra Leone. While we find no overall association between household wealth and EVD exposure, we find that pooled data mask important differences observed within countries with higher wealth households more likely to have been exposed to EVD in Sierra Leone and the opposite relationship in Liberia.

Accurate forecasts of the effectiveness of interventions against Ebola may require models that account for variations in symptoms during infection,"Hart, W. S.; Hochfilzer, L. F. R.; Cunniffe, N.

Most models of interventions targeting symptomatic hosts, such as isolation or treatment, assume that all symptomatic hosts are equally likely to be detected. In other words, following an incubation period, the level of symptoms displayed by an individual host is assumed to remain constant throughout an infection. In reality, however, symptoms vary between different stages of infection. During an Ebola infection, individuals progress from initial non-specific symptoms through to more severe phases of infection. Here we compare predictions of a model in which a constant symptoms level is assumed to those generated by a more epidemiologically realistic model that accounts for varying symptoms during infection. Both models can reproduce observed epidemic data, as we show by fitting the models to data from the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 2014-16 epidemic in Liberia. However, for both of these epidemics, when interventions are altered identically in the models with and without levels of symptoms that depend on the time since first infection, predictions from the models differ.

During an epidemic, scientists use viral genome data to infer a shared evolutionary history and connect this history to geographic spread. We propose a model that directly relates a pathogen's evolution to its spatial contagion dynamics-effectively combining the two epidemiological paradigms of phylogenetic inference and self-exciting process modeling-and apply this phylogenetic Hawkes process to a Bayesian analysis of 23 421 viral cases from the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The proposed model is able to detect individual viruses with significantly elevated rates of spatiotemporal propagation for a subset of 1610 samples that provide genome data.

Despite porous international borders and considerable population movement, however, transmission has been confined to North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Factors potentially contributing to this containment include conduct of about 55 million screenings, surveillance of contacts (12,591 under surveillance currently), testing of 280 samples per day, provision of safe and dignified burials for most deaths, vaccination of high-risk people (112,485 vaccinated as of May 7, 2019), and medical treatment including four investigational therapies.

A SEIR model with memory effects for the propagation of Ebola-like infections and its dynamically consistent approximation,"Iqbal, Z.; Macías-Díaz, J. E.; Ahmed, N.; Aziz-Ur Rehman, M.; Raza, A.; Rafiq, M.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We present and analyze a nonstandard numerical method to solve an epidemic model with memory that describes the propagation of Ebola-type diseases. The epidemiological system contemplates the presence of sub-populations of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered individuals, along with nonlinear interactions between the members of those sub-populations. The system possesses disease-free and endemic equilibrium points, whose stability is studied rigorously. METHODS: To solve the epidemic model with memory, a nonstandard approach based on Grünwald-Letnikov differences is used to discretize the problem. The discretization is conveniently carried out in order to produce a fully explicit and non-singular scheme. The discrete problem is thus well defined for any set of non-negative initial conditions. RESULTS: The existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the discrete problem for non-negative initial data is thoroughly proved. Moreover, the positivity and the boundedness of the approximations is also theoretically elucidated. Some simulations confirm the validity of these theoretical results. Moreover, the simulations prove that the computational model is capable of preserving the equilibria of the system (both the disease-free and the endemic equilibria) as well as the stability of those points. CONCLUSIONS: Both theoretical and numerical results establish that the computational method proposed in this work is capable of preserving distinctive features of an epidemiological model with memory for the propagation of Ebola-type diseases. Among the main characteristics of the numerical integrator, the existence and the uniqueness of solutions, the preservation of both positivity and boundedness, the preservation of the equilibrium points and their stabilities as well as the easiness to implement it computationally are the most important features of the approach proposed in this manuscript.",2021,Sep,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,209,,106322,34390936,10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106322,,#16968,Iqbal 2021,"",""

However, viral load in Ebola virus disease is currently estimated using numerous different assays and protocols that were not developed or validated for this purpose. Here, our aim was to conduct a laboratory-based re-evaluation of the viral loads of a large cohort of Liberian patients with Ebola virus disease and analyse these data in the broader context of the west Africa epidemic. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, whole blood samples from patients at the Eternal Love Winning Africa Ebola treatment unit (Monrovia, Liberia) were re-extracted with an optimised protocol and analysed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) using a novel semi-strand specific assay to measure viral load. To allow for more direct comparisons, the ddPCR viral loads were also back-calculated to cycle threshold (C(t)) values. The new viral load data were then compared with the C(t) values from the original diagnostic quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) testing to identify differing trends and discrepancies. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28 and Dec 18, 2014, 727 whole blood samples from 528 individuals were collected. 463 (64%) were first-draw samples and 409 (56%) were from patients positive for Ebola virus (EBOV), species Zaire ebolavirus. Of the 307 first-draw EBOV-positive samples, 127 (41%) were from survivors and 180 (59%) were from non-survivors; 155 (50%) were women, 145 (47%) were men, and seven (2%) were not recorded, and the mean age was 29·3 (SD 15·0) years for women and 31·8 (SD 14·8) years for men. Survivors had significantly lower mean viral loads at presentation than non-survivors in both the reanalysed dataset (5·61 [95% CI 5·34-5·87] vs 7·19 [6·99-7·38] log(10) EBOV RNA copies per mL; p<0·0001) and diagnostic dataset (C(t) value 28·72 [27·97-29·47] vs 26·26 [25·72-26·81]; p<0·0001). However, the prognostic capacity of viral load increased with the reanalysed dataset (odds ratio [OR] of death 8·06 [95% CI 4·81-13·53], p<0·0001 for viral loads above 6·71 log(10) EBOV RNA copies per mL vs OR of death 2·02 [1·27-3·20], p=0·0028 for C(t) values below 27·37). Diagnostic qRT-PCR significantly (p<0·0001) underestimated viral load in both survivors and non-survivors (difference in diagnostic C(t) value minus laboratory C(t) value of 1·79 [95% CI 1·16-2·43] for survivors and 5·15 [4·43-5·87] for non-survivors). Six samples that were reported negative by diagnostic testing were found to be positive upon reanalysis and had high viral loads. INTERPRETATION: Inaccurate viral load estimation from diagnostic C(t) values is probably multifactorial; however, unaddressed PCR inhibition from tissue damage in patients with fulminant Ebola virus disease could largely account for the discrepancies observed in our study.

Modelling the impact of stigmatisation of Ebola survivors on the disease transmission dynamics,"Juga, M.; Nyabadza, F.; Chirove, F.",Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the most highly stigmatised diseases in any affected country because of the disease's high infectivity and case fatality rate. Infected individuals and most especially survivors are often stigmatised by their communities for fear of contagion. We propose and analyse a mathematical model to examine the impact of stigmatisation of Ebola survivors on the disease dynamics. The model captures both the internal stigmatisation experienced by infected individuals after witnessing survivors being stigmatised and the external stigmatisation imposed on survivors by their communities. The results obtained from our analysis and simulations show that both internal and external stigma may lead to an increase in the burden of Ebola virus disease by sustaining the number of infected individuals who hide their infection and the number of unsafe burials of deceased Ebola victims. Strategies that seek to put an end to both forms of stigmatisation and promote safe burials will therefore go a long way in averting the EVD burden.,2023,Mar 24,Sci Rep,13,1,4859,36964196,10.1038/s41598-023-32040-6,,#17096,Juga 2023,"",""

Here, using data from Sierra Leone, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of recent cholera and Ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two pathogens in the same population. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogen's incubation period on the dynamics of spread and the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history, both empirically and in our simulations. Our results show that diseases with longer incubation periods, such as Ebola, where infected individuals can travel farther before becoming infectious, result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease trajectories, as compared to the more predictable wave-like spread of diseases with shorter incubation periods, such as cholera.",2020,Mar 3,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,117,9,5067-5073,32054785,10.1073/pnas.1913052117,,#17111,Kahn 2020,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-15 00:44:12)(Select): use existing model; ,""
Severity score for predicting in-facility Ebola treatment outcome,"Kangbai, J. B.; Heumann, C.; Hoelscher, M.; Sahr, F.; Froeschl, G.","PURPOSE: Sierra Leone recorded the highest incidence rate for the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak. In this investigation, we used the medical records of Ebola patients with different sociodemographic and clinical features to determine the factors that are associated with Ebola treatment outcome during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and constructed a predictive in-facility mortality score. METHODS: We used the anonymized medical records of 1077 laboratory-confirmed pediatric and adult patients with EVD who received treatment at the 34 Military Hospital and the Police Training School Ebola Treatment Centers in Sierra Leone between the period of June 2014 and April 2015. We later determined the in-facility case fatality rates for Ebola, the odds of dying during Ebola treatment, and later constructed a predictive in-facility mortality score for these patients based on their clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: We constructed a model that partitioned the study population into three mortality risk groups of equal patient numbers, based on risk scoring: low (score ≤ -5), medium (score -4 to 1), and high-risk group (score ≥ 2). The CFR of patients with EVD belonging to the low- (≤-5), medium (-4 to 1), and high- (≥2) risk groups were 0.56%, 9.75%, and 67.41%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We succeeded in designing an in-facility mortality risk score that reflects EVD clinical severity and can assist in the clinical prioritization of patients with EVD.",2020,Sep,Ann Epidemiol,49,,68-74,32763341,10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.07.017,,#17137,Kangbai 2020,Rebecca Nash (2023-08-11 19:37:14)(Select): CFRs; ,""
Sociodemographic and clinical determinants of in-facility case fatality rate for 938 adult Ebola patients treated at Sierra Leone Ebola treatment center,"Kangbai, J. B.; Heumann, C.; Hoelscher, M.; Sahr, F.; Froeschl, G.","BACKGROUND: The 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak recorded the highest incidence and mortality since the discovery of the virus in Zaire in 1976; with more than 28,000 probable and confirmed EVD cases and 11,000 deaths. Studies relating to previous outbreaks usually involved small sample sizes. In this study we are set to identify those sociodemographic and clinical features that predict in-facility mortality among EVD patients using a large sample size. METHODS: We analysed the anonymized medical records of 938 laboratory-confirmed EVD patients 15 years old and above who received treatment at The 34 Military Hospital and The Police Training School EVD Treatment Centers in Sierra Leone in the period June 2014 to April 2015. We used both univariable and multivariable logistic regression to determine the predictors for in-facility mortality of these patients based on their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The median age of the EVD cases was 33 years (interquartile range = 25 to 40 years). The majority of the EVD cases were male (59.0%) and had secondary level education (79.3%). We reported a low overall in-facility case fatality rate of 26.4%. The associations between case fatality rates and EVD patients who reported fever, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, haemorrhage, dysphagia, conjunctival injection, dyspnea, and skin rash at the time of admission were all statistically significant (p <  0.05). Our preferred model with the age group 65 years and above alongside the following clinical symptoms; diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, dysphagia, conjunctival injection, dyspnea and cough produced a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an AUC (area under the curve) value of 0.93. CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a simple model that can be optimally used alongside other rapid EVD diagnostic tools to identify EVD in-facility treatment mortality predictors based on the sociodemographic characteristics and clinical symptoms of adult EVD patients. We also reported low EVD cases among patients with secondary and tertiary education. These subpopulations of our patients who are generally informed about the signs and symptoms of EVD, alongside our treatment regimen may have been responsible for our comparatively lower case fatality rate.",2020,Apr 21,BMC Infect Dis,20,1,293,32316923,10.1186/s12879-020-04994-9,,#17138,Kangbai 2020,Rebecca Nash (2023-08-14 22:28:19)(Select): CFR and risk factors; ,""
Factors associated with length of stay and treatment outcome of Ebola patients treated at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone during the peak period of the West African Ebola outbreak 2013-2016,"Kangbai, J. B.; Heumann, C.; Hoelscher, M.; Sahr, F.; Froeschl, G.","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the West Africa Ebola epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2014. During the outbreak period, there were calls for the affected countries to construct Ebola treatment centres and reliable diagnostic laboratories closer to areas of transmission in order to improve the quality care of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) patients. Delay in seeking treatment has been reported to have led to poor treatment outcome of EVD patients. Sierra Leone recorded more than 8000 probable and confirmed cases and more than 4000 EVD -related deaths nation-wide. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated the effects of treatment delay, length of symptomatic period, EVD patients' sex, age, occupation, region of residence, and clinical characteristics on the treatment outcome of 205 laboratory-confirmed EVD patients who were admitted at the Kenema Government Hospital Ebola Treatment Center (KGHETC) from 13/09/2014-26/11/2014; i.e. during the peak of 2013-2016 EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone. Specifically also, we determined the factors that were associated with the length of stay for EVD treatment for patients who were discharged alive. RESULTS: Majority (66.3%, n = 205/309) of the 309 suspected EVD patients with medical records at the KGHETC triage during the period under review were tested positive for EVD using reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and had a definitive treatment outcome. Few (33.7%, n = 104/309) suspected EVD patients were not included in our analysis and were classified thus: 29.1% (n = 90/309) suspect EVD cases with negative RT-PCR results, 4.5% (n = 14/309) suspect cases with non-available RT-PCR result. Of the 205 patients, 99 (48.3%) had a fatal outcome. For EVD patients that survived, we recorded a significant association (- 0.06, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = - 0.14 - - 0.02, p = 0.004) between the Length of Stay (LOS) and for each kilometer travelled to seek treatment at the KGHETC. However, the association between EVD patients that were low skilled workers (- 5.91, 95% CI = - 24.60 - 12.79, p = 0.73), EVD patients who were children and pupils in junior school (- 0.86, 95% CI = - 12.86 - 11.14, p = 0.73), health seeking delay for EVD patients who resided in Kenema District where the KGHETC was located (- 0.49, 95% CI = - 0.12 - 1.09, p = 0.24), sex (- 1.77, 95% CI = - 8.75 - 5.21, p = 0.50), age (0.21, 95% CI = - 0.36 - 0.77, p = 0.57), referral status (1.21, 95% CI = - 17.67 - 20.09, p = 0.89) and the LOS in surviving patients were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The high LOS for either treatment outcome for EVD patients that resided in the district in which the EVD treatment facility was located compared to those patients from other districts implies that health authorities should consider intensive health education with high priority given to seeking early EVD treatment, and the construction of strategic ETCs as important components in their response strategy.",2021,Jul 12,Arch Public Health,79,1,131,34253262,10.1186/s13690-021-00653-w,,#17139,Kangbai 2021,"Rebecca Nash (2023-08-15 01:55:38)(Select): human delays, cfr, risk factors; ",""

This is the first outbreak for which the recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus - Zaire Ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) candidate vaccine has been widely administered, using a ring vaccination strategy. We examined whether prior vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV impacts viral load, organ impairment, and survival among patients with EVD admitted to Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in the DRC. We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients admitted to the ETUs in Butembo and Katwa, Eastern DRC, between 30 March and 10 August 2019. We included 257 patients, of whom 44 had been vaccinated prior to admission and 213 were unvaccinated. Vaccinated patients were admitted to hospital sooner than unvaccinated patients (median 2 days (IQR 1.8-4) versus 4 days (IQR 3-6), p < 0.001). Vaccinated patients had a lower viral load at admission compared to those who were unvaccinated: 6.0 log(10) cp/mL (IQR 5.0-7.1) versus 6.9 log(10) cp/mL (IQR 5.4-7.6), p = 0.017. In a longitudinal analysis of daily viral load measurements, vaccinated patients had an overall viremia 1.32 log(10) cp/mL (95% CI 0.58-2.1) lower than unvaccinated patients over the course of their infection. Acute kidney injury at admission was less common in vaccinated patients: OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.20-0.94), p = 0.027.

S.","INTRODUCTION: Despite tremendous progress in the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease (EVD), challenges remain in the implementation of holistic strategies to rapidly curtail outbreaks. We investigated the effectiveness of a community-based contact isolation strategy to limit the spread of the disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: We did a quasi-experimental comparison study. Eligible participants were EVD contacts registered from 12 June 2019 to 18 May 2020 in Beni and Mabalako Health Zones. Intervention group participants were isolated to specific community sites for the duration of their follow-up. Comparison group participants underwent contact tracing without isolation. The primary outcome was measured as the reproduction number (R) in the two groups. Secondary outcomes were the delay from symptom onset to isolation and case management, case fatality rate (CFR) and vaccination uptake. RESULTS: 27 324 EVD contacts were included in the study; 585 in the intervention group and 26 739 in the comparison group. The intervention group generated 32 confirmed cases (5.5%) in the first generation, while the comparison group generated 87 (0.3%). However, the 32 confirmed cases arising from the intervention contacts did not generate any additional transmission (R=0.00), whereas the 87 confirmed cases arising from the comparison group generated 99 secondary cases (R=1.14). The average delay between symptom onset and case isolation was shorter (1.3 vs 4.8 days; p<0.0001), CFR lower (12.5% vs 48.4%; p=0.0001) and postexposure vaccination uptake higher (86.0% vs 56.8%; p<0.0001) in the intervention group compared with the comparison group. A significant difference was also found between intervention and comparison groups in survival rate at the discharge of hospitalised confirmed patients (87.9% vs 47.7%, respectively; p=0.0004). CONCLUSION: The community-based contact isolation strategy used in DRC shows promise as a potentially effective approach for the rapid cessation of EVD transmission, highlighting the importance of rapidly implemented, community-oriented and trust-building control strategies.",2023,Jun,BMJ Glob Health,8,6,,37263672,10.1136/bmjgh-2023-011907,,#17192,Keita 2023,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-09 22:32:11)(Select): delay; ,""

METHODS: From September 2016 to July 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional, community-based study of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and household contacts of several transmission chains in Kono District, Sierra Leone. We analyzed 154 quarantined households, comprising both reported EVD cases and their close contacts. We used epidemiological surveys and blood samples to define severity of illness as no infection, pauci-/asymptomatic infection, unrecognized EVD, reported EVD cases who survived, or reported EVD decedents. We determine seropositivity with the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group EBOV glycoprotein immunoglobulin G antibody test. We defined levels of exposure risk from 8 questions and considered contact with body fluid as maximum exposure risk. RESULTS: Our analysis included 76 reported EVD cases (both decedents and survivors) and 421 close contacts. Among these contacts, 40 were seropositive (22 paucisymptomatic and 18 unrecognized EVD), accounting for 34% of the total 116 EBOV infections. Higher exposure risks were associated with having had EBOV infection (maximum risk: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 12.1 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.8-25.4; trend test: P < .001) and more severe illness (maximum risk: AOR, 25.2 [95% CI, 6.2-102.4]; trend test: P < .001).

As this outbreak continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of people already suffering from civil strife and armed conflict, relatively simple mathematical models and their short-term predictions have the potential to inform Ebola response efforts in real time. We applied recently developed non-parametrically estimated Hawkes point processes to model the expected cumulative case count using daily case counts from May 3, 2018, to June 16, 2019, initially reported by the Ministry of Health of DRC and later confirmed in World Health Organization situation reports. We generated probabilistic estimates of the ongoing EVD outbreak in DRC extending both before and after June 16, 2019, and evaluated their accuracy by comparing forecasted vs. actual outbreak sizes, out-of-sample log-likelihood scores and the error per day in the median forecast. The median estimated outbreak sizes for the prospective thee-, six-, and nine-week projections made using data up to June 16, 2019, were, respectively, 2317 (95% PI: 2222, 2464); 2440 (95% PI: 2250, 2790); and 2544 (95% PI: 2273, 3205). The nine-week projection experienced some degradation with a daily error in the median forecast of 6.73 cases, while the six- and three-week projections were more reliable, with corresponding errors of 4.96 and 4.85 cases per day, respectively.

We aim to estimate the outbreak scale when an EVD infected person arrives in Korea. METHODS: Western Africa EVD epidemic mathematical model SEIJR or SEIJQR was modified to create a Korean EVD outbreak model. The expected number of EVD patients and outbreak duration were calculated by stochastic simulation under the scenarios of Best case, Diagnosis delay, and Case missing. RESULTS: The 2,000 trials of stochastic simulation for each scenario demonstrated the following results: The possible median number of patients is 2 and the estimated maximum number is 11 when the government intervention is proceeded immediately right after the first EVD case is confirmed. With a 6-day delay in diagnosis of the first case, the median number of patients becomes 7, and the maximum, 20. If the first case is missed and the government intervention is not activated until 2 cases of secondary infection occur, the median number of patients is estimated at 15, and the maximum, at 35.

Here we describe a flexible transmission model to test the utility of generalised human movement models in estimating EVD cases and spatial spread over the course of the outbreak. A transmission model that includes a general model of human mobility significantly improves prediction of EVD's incidence compared to models without this component. Human movement plays an important role not only to ignite the epidemic in locations previously disease free, but over the course of the entire epidemic. We also demonstrate important differences between countries in population mixing and the improved prediction attributable to movement metrics. Given their relative rareness, locally derived mobility data are unlikely to exist in advance of future epidemics or pandemics. Our findings show that transmission patterns derived from general human movement models can improve forecasts of spatio-temporal transmission patterns in places where local mobility data is unavailable.",2019,Mar 26,Sci Rep,9,1,5151,30914669,10.1038/s41598-019-41192-3,,#17333,Kraemer 2019,"",""

J.; Cauchemez, S.","BACKGROUND: The 2018-2019 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the largest ever recorded in the DRC. It has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The outbreak emerged in a region of chronic conflict and insecurity, and directed attacks against health care workers may have interfered with disease response activities. Our study characterizes and quantifies the broader conflict dynamics over the course of the outbreak by pairing epidemiological and all available spatial conflict data. METHODS: We build a set of conflict variables by mapping the spatial locations of all conflict events and their associated deaths in each of the affected health zones in North Kivu and Ituri, eastern DRC, before and during the outbreak. Using these data, we compare patterns of conflict before and during the outbreak in affected health zones and those not affected. We then test whether conflict is correlated with increased EVD transmission at the health zone level. FINDINGS: The incidence of conflict events per capita is ~ 600 times more likely in Ituri and North Kivu than for the rest of the DRC. We identified 15 time periods of substantial uninterrupted transmission across 11 health zones and a total of 120 bi-weeks. We do not find significant short-term associations between the bi-week reproduction numbers and the number of conflicts. However, we do find that the incidence of conflict per capita was correlated with the incidence of EVD per capita at the health zone level for the entire outbreak (Pearson's r = 0.33, 95% CI 0.05-0.57). In the two provinces, the monthly number of conflict events also increased by a factor of 2.7 in Ebola-affected health zones (p value < 0.05) compared to 2.0 where no transmission was reported and 1.3 in the rest of the DRC, in the period between February 2019 and July 2019. CONCLUSION: We characterized the association between variables documenting broad conflict levels and EVD transmission. Such assessment is important to understand if and how such conflict variables could be used to inform the outbreak response. We found that while these variables can help characterize long-term challenges and susceptibilities of the different regions they provide little insight on the short-term dynamics of EVD transmission.",2020,Apr 27,BMC Med,18,1,113,32336281,10.1186/s12916-020-01574-1,,#17334,Kraemer 2020,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-11 18:34:39)(Select): risk factor; ,""
Agent-based analysis of contagion events according to sourcing locations,"Kustudic, M.; Niu, B.; Liu, Q.","The first human infected with the Covid-19 virus was traced to a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Research shows that there are comparable types of viruses found in different and mutually distant areas. This raises several questions: what if the virus originated in another location? How will future waves of epidemics behave if they originate from different locations with a smaller/larger population than Wuhan? To explore these questions, we implement an agent-based model within fractal cities. Cities radiate gravitational social attraction based on their Zipfian population. The probability and predictability of contagion events are analyzed by examining fractal dimensions and lacunarity. Results show that weak gravitational forces of small locations help dissipate infections across country quicker if the pathogen had originated from that location. Gravitational forces of large cities help contain infections within them if they are the starting locations for the pathogen. Greater connectedness and symmetry allow for a more predictable epidemic outcome since there are no obstructions to spreading.

We devised a statistical model to compute the probability of the end of an Ebola virus disease epidemic, accounting for sexual transmission and under-ascertainment of cases. Analyzing the empirical data in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the performance of the proposed model was compared with the existing criteria comprising a fixed waiting time of 42 days since the last case testing negative or burial. We showed that the waiting time can vary depending on the sexual behaviors of survivors and their adherence to refraining from unprotected sex is likely one of the key factors in determining the absence of additional cases after declaration. If the proportional weight of sexual transmission among all secondary transmission events was substantial, ascertaining the end could even require waiting 1 year from the purported last case.

We did a retrospective genomic characterisation of the outbreak and assessed potential therapeutic agents and vaccine (medical countermeasures). METHODS: We used target-enrichment sequencing to produce Ebola virus genomes from samples obtained in the 2018 Équateur Province outbreak. Combining these genomes with genomes associated with known outbreaks from GenBank, we constructed a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. In-silico analyses were used to assess potential mismatches between the outbreak strain and the probes and primers of diagnostic assays and the antigenic sites of the experimental rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine and therapeutics. An in-vitro flow cytometry assay was used to assess the binding capability of the individual components of the monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp. FINDINGS: A targeted sequencing approach produced 16 near-complete genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of these genomes and 1011 genomes from GenBank revealed a distinct cluster, confirming a new Ebola virus variant, for which we propose the name ""Tumba"".

We found few sequence mismatches in the assessed assay target regions and antigenic sites. We identified nine amino acid changes in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, of which one resulted in reduced binding of the 13C6 antibody within the ZMapp cocktail. INTERPRETATION: Retrospectively, we show the feasibility of using genomics to rapidly characterise a new Ebola virus variant within the timeframe of an outbreak.

Bayesian Inference of Evolutionary Histories under Time-Dependent Substitution Rates,"Membrebe, J. V.; Suchard, M. A.; Rambaut, A.; Baele, G.; Lemey, P.","Many factors complicate the estimation of time scales for phylogenetic histories, requiring increasingly complex evolutionary models and inference procedures. The widespread application of molecular clock dating has led to the insight that evolutionary rate estimates may vary with the time frame of measurement. This is particularly well established for rapidly evolving viruses that can accumulate sequence divergence over years or even months. However, this rapid evolution stands at odds with a relatively high degree of conservation of viruses or endogenous virus elements over much longer time scales. Building on recent insights into time-dependent evolutionary rates, we develop a formal and flexible Bayesian statistical inference approach that accommodates rate variation through time. We evaluate the novel molecular clock model on a foamy virus cospeciation history and a lentivirus evolutionary history and compare the performance to other molecular clock models. For both virus examples, we estimate a similarly strong time-dependent effect that implies rates varying over four orders of magnitude. The application of an analogous codon substitution model does not implicate long-term purifying selection as the cause of this effect. However, selection does appear to affect divergence time estimates for the less deep evolutionary history of the Ebolavirus genus. Finally, we explore the application of our approach on woolly mammoth ancient DNA data, which shows a much weaker, but still important, time-dependent rate effect that has a noticeable impact on node age estimates.

It is investigated whether or not incubation period, infectious period and transmission rates are different among districts. Estimation is done using the Bayesian formalism. The posterior estimates of the effective reproductive number were substantially different across the districts, with pronounced variability in districts with few cases of Ebola. The posterior estimates of the reproductive number at the district level varied between below 1.0 and 4.5, whereas at nationwide level it varied between below 1.0 and 2.5. The posterior estimate of the effective reproductive number reached a value below 1.0 around December. In some districts, the effective reproductive number pointed out for the persistence of the outbreak or for a likely resurgence of new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD). The posterior estimates have shown to be highly sensitive to prior elicitation, mainly the incubation period and infectious period.",2021,,PLoS One,16,5,e0250765,33983966,10.1371/journal.pone.0250765,,#17956,Muleia 2021,"",""
Estimation of Ebola's spillover infection exposure in Sierra Leone based on sociodemographic and economic factors,"Mursel, S.; Alter, N.; Slavit, L.; Smith, A.; Bocchini, P.; Buceta, J.","Zoonotic diseases spread through pathogens-infected animal carriers. In the case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), evidence supports that the main carriers are fruit bats and non-human primates. Further, EVD spread is a multi-factorial problem that depends on sociodemographic and economic (SDE) factors. Here we inquire into this phenomenon and aim at determining, quantitatively, the Ebola spillover infection exposure map and try to link it to SDE factors. To that end, we designed and conducted a survey in Sierra Leone and implement a pipeline to analyze data using regression and machine learning techniques. Our methodology is able (1) to identify the features that are best predictors of an individual's tendency to partake in behaviors that can expose them to Ebola infection, (2) to develop a predictive model about the spillover risk statistics that can be calibrated for different regions and future times, and (3) to compute a spillover exposure map for Sierra Leone. Our results and conclusions are relevant to identify the regions in Sierra Leone at risk of EVD spillover and, consequently, to design and implement policies for an effective deployment of resources (e.g., drug supplies) and other preventative measures (e.g., educational campaigns).",2022,,PLoS One,17,9,e0271886,36048780,10.1371/journal.pone.0271886,,#17981,Mursel 2022,Rebecca Nash (2023-08-10 20:57:50)(Select): risk factors for infection spillover; ,""

We aimed to characterise the clinical indicators associated with Ebola virus disease to improve outbreak response. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we assessed routinely collected data from individuals with possible Ebola virus disease attending 30 Ebola health facilities in two provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between Aug 1, 2018, and Aug 28, 2019. We used logistic regression analysis to model the probability of Ebola infection across 34 clinical variables and four types of possible Ebola virus disease exposures: contact with an individual known to have Ebola virus disease, attendance at any funeral, health facility consultation, or consultation with an informal health practitioner. FINDINGS: Data for 24 666 individuals were included. If a patient presented to care in the early symptomatic phase (ie, days 0-2), Ebola virus disease positivity was most associated with previous exposure to an individual with Ebola virus disease (odds ratio [OR] 11·9, 95% CI 9·1-15·8), funeral attendance (2·1, 1·6-2·7), or health facility consultations (2·1, 1·6-2·8), rather than clinical parameters. If presentation occurred on day 3 or later (after symptom onset), bleeding at an injection site (OR 33·9, 95% CI 12·7-101·3), bleeding gums (7·5, 3·7-15·4), conjunctivitis (2·4, 1·7-3·4), asthenia (1·9, 1·5-2·3), sore throat (1·8, 1·3-2·4), dysphagia (1·8, 1·4-2·3), and diarrhoea (1·6, 1·3-1·9) were additional strong predictors of Ebola virus disease.

INTERPRETATION: Establishing the exact time an individual first had symptoms is essential to assessing their infection risk. An individual's exposure history remains of paramount importance, especially in the early phase.

We investigated the seroprevalence and risk factors for Marburg virus and ebolaviruses in gold mining communities around Kitaka gold mine in Western Uganda and compared them to non-mining communities in Central Uganda. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered and human blood samples were collected from three exposure groups in Western Uganda (gold miners, household members of miners, non-miners living within 50 km of Kitaka mine). The unexposed controls group sampled was community members in Central Uganda far away from any gold mining activity which we considered as low-risk for filovirus infection. ELISA serology was used to analyse samples, detecting IgG antibodies against Marburg virus and ebolaviruses (filoviruses). Data were analysed in STATA software using risk ratios and odds ratios. RESULTS: Miners in western Uganda were 5.4 times more likely to be filovirus seropositive compared to the control group in central Uganda (RR = 5.4; 95% CI 1.5-19.7) whereas people living in high-risk areas in Ibanda and Kamwenge districts were 3.6 more likely to be seropositive compared to control group in Luweeero district (RR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-12.2). Among all participants, filovirus seropositivity was 2.6% (19/724) of which 2.3% (17/724) were reactive to Sudan virus only and 0.1% (1/724) to Marburg virus. One individual seropositive for Sudan virus also had IgG antibodies reactive to Bundibugyo virus. The risk factors for filovirus seropositivity identified included mining (AOR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-8.5), male sex (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.01-9.5), going inside mines (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.2-8.2), cleaning corpses (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.04-9.1) and contact with suspect filovirus cases (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.04-14.5). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that filovirus outbreaks may go undetected in Uganda and people involved in artisan gold mining are more likely to be exposed to infection with either Marburg virus or ebolaviruses, likely due to increased risk of exposure to bats.

Economic evaluation using dynamic transition modeling of ebola virus vaccination in lower-and-middle-income countries,"Obeng-Kusi, M.; Habila, M. A.; Roe, D. J.; Erstad, B.; Abraham, I.","BACKGROUND: With the increasing occurrence of infectious diseases in lower-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), emergency preparedness is essential for rapid response and mitigation. Economic evaluations of mitigation technologies and strategies have been recommended for inclusion in emergency preparedness plans. We aimed to perform an economic evaluation using dynamic transition modeling of ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccination in a hypothetical community of 1,000 persons in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHOD: Using a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, with Death added [SEIR-D]) model that accounted for death and epidemiological data from an EVD outbreak in the DRC, we modeled the transmission of EVD in a hypothetical population of 1,000. With our model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of an EVD vaccine and an EVD vaccination intervention. RESULTS: The results showed vaccinating 50% of the population at risk prevented 670 cases, 538 deaths, and 22,022 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The vaccine was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $95.63 per DALY averted. We also determined the minimum required vaccination coverage for cost-effectiveness to be 40%. Sensitivity analysis showed our model to be fairly robust, assuring relatively consistent results even with variations in such input parameters as cost of screening, as well as transmission, infection, incubation, and case fatality rates. CONCLUSION: EVD vaccination in our hypothetical population was found to be cost-effective from the payer perspective. Our model presents an efficient and reliable approach for conducting economic evaluations of infectious disease interventions as part of an emergency preparedness plan.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYInfectious diseases affect lower-and-middle-income (LMIC) countries, with their limited resources, disproportionately more. This is certainly the case for ebola virus disease (EVD), a rare, severe, and mostly fatal disease. Vaccination is now available, but whether it is cost-effective remains an open question. We evaluated its cost-effectiveness by modeling the spread of EVD in a hypothetical population of 1000 persons. Using data from an EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we estimated how many of persons susceptible to infection were exposed to the virus, became infected, recovered, or died. We did so for two scenarios: vaccinating versus not vaccinating enough people to achieve herd immunity. We assumed vaccinating 50% of the people and estimated how many infections, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY; the loss of the equivalent of a year of full health) would be prevented by vaccination. Our cost-effectiveness metric was the incremental cost of preventing one DALY.The outcomes of vaccination offset the additional costs. Vaccinating 50% of the population of 1000 cost an additional $2,081,358 but prevented 670 infections, 538 deaths, and 22022 DALYs. Preventing one DALY cost $95.63. This is very cost-effective as it is less than the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for the DRC of $556.81. Vaccination below 40% of the population was less cost-effective, was most cost-effective at the herd immunity threshold of 45.3%, beyond which there were diminishing returns. Summarized, vaccination against EVD is clinically very effective and certainly worth the additional cost.eng",2021,Nov,J Med Econ,24,sup1,1-13,34866541,10.1080/13696998.2021.2002092,,#18120,Obeng-Kusi 2021,"",""

During the 2014 Ebola Virus outbreak, the disease devastated and threatened the whole world. EVD symptoms (fever, diarrhea, vomiting, etc) may appear anywhere between two to twenty-one days after infection. Those that recovered from the disease return to being susceptible again and can transmit the virus through semen as research has shown the virus presence in semen even after recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mathematical modeling method with the combination of vaccine, condom use, quarantine, isolation and treatment drug together as control measures in a population consisting of human and animals. A model system of non-linear differential equations for the control of EVD was formulated and the model effective reproduction number (R(E) ) was obtained using the next generation matrix method and used in the stability analysis of the model. Center manifold theorem was used in the bifurcation analysis of the model. RESULTS: The result shows that the stability analysis of the model shows that the EVD - Free Equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R(E) > 1 and EVD - Endemic Equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R(E) > 1. The model was shown to exhibit a forward bifurcation.

A fractional order epidemic model for the simulation of outbreaks of Ebola,"Pan, W.; Li, T.; Ali, S.","The Ebola outbreak in 2014 caused many infections and deaths. Some literature works have proposed some models to study Ebola virus, such as SIR, SIS, SEIR, etc. It is proved that the fractional order model can describe epidemic dynamics better than the integer order model. In this paper, we propose a fractional order Ebola system and analyze the nonnegative solution, the basic reproduction number R0 , and the stabilities of equilibrium points for the system firstly. In many studies, the numerical solutions of some models cannot fit very well with the real data. Thus, to show the dynamics of the Ebola epidemic, the Gorenflo-Mainardi-Moretti-Paradisi scheme (GMMP) is taken to get the numerical solution of the SEIR fractional order Ebola system and the modified grid approximation method (MGAM) is used to acquire the parameters of the SEIR fractional order Ebola system. We consider that the GMMP method may lead to absurd numerical solutions, so its stability and convergence are given. Then, the new fractional orders, parameters, and the root-mean-square relative error g(U∗) = 0.4146 are obtained. With the new fractional orders and parameters, the numerical solution of the SEIR fractional order Ebola system is closer to the real data than those models in other literature works. Meanwhile, we find that most of the fractional order Ebola systems have the same order. Hence, the fractional order Ebola system with different orders using the Caputo derivatives is also studied. We also adopt the MGAM algorithm to obtain the new orders, parameters, and the root-mean-square relative error which is g(U∗) = 0.2744 .

J.","BACKGROUND: Experience from the Zaire Ebolavirus epidemic in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018-2020) demonstrates that early initiation of essential critical care and administration of Zaire Ebolavirus specific monoclonal antibodies may be associated with improved outcomes among patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD). OBJECTIVES: This series describes 13 EVD patients and 276 patients with suspected EVD treated during a Zaire Ebolavirus outbreak in Guinea in 2021. METHOD: Patients with confirmed or suspected EVD were treated in two Ebola treatment centres (ETC) in the region of N'zérékoré. Data were reviewed from all patients with suspected or confirmed EVD hospitalised in these two ETCs during the outbreak (14 February 2021 - 19 June 2021). Ebola-specific monoclonal antibodies, were available 2 weeks after onset of the outbreak. RESULTS: Nine of the 13 EVD patients (age range: 22-70 years) survived. The four EVD patients who died, including one pregnant woman, presented with multi-organ dysfunction and died within 48 h of admission. All eight patients who received Ebola-specific monoclonal antibodies survived. Four of the 13 EVD patients were health workers. Improvement of ETC design facilitated implementation of WHO-recommended 'optimized supportive care for EVD'. In this context, pragmatic clinical training was integrated in routine ETC activities. Initial clinical manifestations of 13 confirmed EVD patients were similar to those of 276 patients with suspected, but subsequently non confirmed EVD. These patients suffered from other acute infections (e.g. malaria in 183 of 276 patients; 66%). Five of the 276 patients with suspected EVD died. One of these five patients had Lassa virus disease and a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) co-infection. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary outbreak response teams can rapidly optimise ETC design. Trained clinical teams can provide WHO-recommended optimised supportive care, including safe administration of Ebola-specific monoclonal antibodies. Pragmatic training in essential critical care can be integrated in routine ETC activities. CONTRIBUTION: This article describes clinical realities associated with implementation of WHO-recommended standards of 'optimized supportive care' and administration of Ebola virus specific treatments. In this context, the importance of essential design principles of ETCs is underlined, which allow continuous visual contact and verbal interaction of health workers and families with their patients.

Impact of prophylactic vaccination strategies on Ebola virus transmission: A modeling analysis,"Potluri, R.; Kumar, A.; Maheshwari, V.; Smith, C.; Oriol Mathieu, V.; Luhn, K.; Callendret, B.; Bhandari, H.","Ebola epidemics constitute serious public health emergencies. Multiple vaccines are under development to prevent these epidemics and avoid the associated morbidity and mortality. Assessing the potential impact of these vaccines on morbidity and mortality of Ebola is essential for devising prevention strategies. A mean-field compartmental stochastic model was developed for this purpose and validated by simulating the 2014 Sierra Leone epidemic. We assessed the impacts of prophylactic vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) both alone and in combination with the vaccination of the general population (entire susceptible population other than HCW). The model simulated 8,706 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 478-21,942) cases and 3,575 (95%CI: 179-9,031) deaths in Sierra Leone, in line with WHO-reported statistics for the 2014 epidemic (8,704 cases and 3,587 deaths). Relative to this base case, the model then estimated that prophylactic vaccination of only 10% of HCW will avert 12% (95% CI: 6%-14%) of overall cases and deaths, while vaccination of 30% of HCW will avert 34% of overall cases (95% CI: 30%-64%) and deaths (95% CI: 30%-65%). Prophylactic vaccination of 1% and 5% of the general population in addition to vaccinating 30% of HCW was estimated to result in reduction in cases by 44% (95% CI: 39%-61%) and 72% (95% CI: 68%-84%) respectively, and deaths by 45% (95% CI: 40%-61%) and 74% (95% CI: 70%-85%) respectively.

Model-based evaluation of the impact of prophylactic vaccination applied to Ebola epidemics in Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo,"Potluri, R.; Kumar, A.; Oriol-Mathieu, V.; Van Effelterre, T.; Metz, L.; Bhandari, H.","BACKGROUND: Protection by preventive Ebola vaccines has been demonstrated in clinical trials, but a complete picture of real-world effectiveness is lacking. Our previous study modeling the impact of preventively vaccinating healthcare workers (HCW) alone or with a proportion of the general population (GP) estimated significant reductions in incidence and mortality. The model assumed 100% vaccine efficacy, which is unlikely in the real world. We enhanced this model to account for lower vaccine efficacy and to factor in reduced infectiousness and lower case fatality rate in vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections. METHODS: The previous model was enhanced to still permit a risk, although lower, for vaccinated individuals to become infected. The enhanced model, calibrated with data from epidemics in Sierra Leone (SL) and North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, helped evaluate the impact of preventive Ebola vaccination in different scenarios based on different vaccine efficacy rates (90% and 30% reductions in infection risk in the base and conservative scenarios, respectively; additionally, both scenarios with 50% reductions in infectiousness and mortality) and vaccination coverage among HCWs (30%, 90%) and GP (0%, 5%, and 10%). RESULTS: The base scenario estimated that, depending upon the proportions of vaccinated HCWs and GP, 33-85% of cases and 34-87% of deaths during the 2014 SL epidemic and 42-89% of cases and 41-89% of deaths during the 2018 North Kivu epidemic would be averted versus no vaccination. Corresponding estimates for the conservative scenario were: 23-74% of cases and 23-77% of deaths averted during the SL epidemic and 31-80% of both cases and deaths averted during the North Kivu epidemic.

Ebola Patient Virus Cycle Threshold and Risk of Household Transmission of Ebola Virus,"Reichler, M. R.; Bruden, D.; Thomas, H.; Erickson, B. R.; Knust, B.; Duffy, N.; Klena, J.; Hennessy, T.","BACKGROUND: Identifying risk factors for household transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) is important to guide preventive measures during Ebola outbreaks. METHODS: We enrolled all confirmed persons with EBOV disease who were the first case patient in a household from December 2014 to April 2015 in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and their household contacts. Index patients and contacts were interviewed, and contacts were followed up for 21 days to identify secondary cases. Epidemiologic data were linked to EBOV real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold (Ct) data from initial diagnostic specimens obtained from enrolled index case patients. RESULTS: Ct data were available for 106 (71%) of 150 enrolled index patients. Of the Ct results, 85 (80%) were from blood specimens from live patients and 21 (20%) from oral swab specimens from deceased patients. The median Ct values for blood and swab specimens were 21.0 and 24.0, respectively (P = .007). In multivariable analysis, a Ct value from blood specimens in the lowest quintile was an independent predictor of both increased risk of household transmission (P = .009) and higher secondary attack rate among household contacts (P = .03), after adjustment for epidemiologic factors.

Risk assessment of Ebola virus disease spreading in Uganda using a two-layer temporal network,"Riad, M. H.; Sekamatte, M.; Ocom, F.; Makumbi, I.; Scoglio, C. M.","Network-based modelling of infectious diseases apply compartmental models on a contact network, which makes the epidemic process crucially dependent on the network structure. For highly contagious diseases such as Ebola virus disease (EVD), interpersonal contact plays the most vital role in human-to-human transmission. Therefore, for accurate representation of EVD spreading, the contact network needs to resemble the reality. Prior research has mainly focused on static networks (only permanent contacts) or activity-driven networks (only temporal contacts) for Ebola spreading. A comprehensive network for EVD spreading should include both these network structures, as there are always some permanent contacts together with temporal contacts. Therefore, we propose a two-layer temporal network for Uganda, which is at risk of an Ebola outbreak from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) epidemic. The network has a permanent layer representing permanent contacts among individuals within the family level, and a data-driven temporal network for human movements motivated by cattle trade, fish trade, or general communications. We propose a Gillespie algorithm with the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model to simulate the evolution of EVD spreading as well as to evaluate the risk throughout our network. As an example, we applied our method to a network consisting of 23 districts along different movement routes in Uganda starting from bordering districts of the DRC to Kampala. Simulation results show that some regions are at higher risk of infection, suggesting some focal points for Ebola preparedness and providing direction to inform interventions in the field. Simulation results also show that decreasing physical contact as well as increasing preventive measures result in a reduction of chances to develop an outbreak. Overall, the main contribution of this paper lies in the novel method for risk assessment, which can be more precise with an increasing volume of accurate data for creating the network model.",2019,Nov 5,Sci Rep,9,1,16060,31690844,10.1038/s41598-019-52501-1,,#18508,Riad 2019,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-11 02:35:42)(Select): network model; ,""
Control of Ebola virus disease outbreaks: Comparison of health care worker-targeted and community vaccination strategies,"Robert, A.; Camacho, A.; Edmunds, W. J.; Baguelin, M.; Muyembe Tamfum, J.

M.","BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCW) are at risk of infection during Ebola virus disease outbreaks and therefore may be targeted for vaccination before or during outbreaks. The effect of these strategies depends on the role of HCW in transmission which is understudied. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of HCW-targeted or community vaccination strategies, we used a transmission model to explore the relative contribution of HCW and the community to transmission. We calibrated the model to data from multiple Ebola outbreaks. We quantified the impact of ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies, and reactive HCW and community vaccination. RESULTS: We found that for some outbreaks (we call ""type 1″) HCW amplified transmission both to other HCW and the community, and in these outbreaks prophylactic vaccination of HCW decreased outbreak size. Reactive vaccination strategies had little effect because type 1 outbreaks ended quickly. However, in outbreaks with longer time courses (""type 2 outbreaks""), reactive community vaccination decreased the number of cases, with or without prophylactic HCW-targeted vaccination. For both outbreak types, we found that ahead-of-time HCW-targeted strategies had an impact at coverage of 30%. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccine strategies tested had a different impact depending on the transmission dynamics and previous control measures.

METHODS: This facility-based cross-sectional study was carried out between June and November 2018 in Buhigwe, Kalambo, Kyela, Kilindi, Kinondoni, Kondoa, Mvomero, and Ukerewe districts in Tanzania. The study involved febrile patients seeking health care from primary healthcare facilities. Blood samples were collected and tested for infections due to malaria, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola virus disease (EVD), Marburg virus disease (MVD), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and yellow fever (YF). Malaria infections were tested using rapid diagnostics tests while exposure to VHFs was determined by screening for immunoglobulin M antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

Forecasting Epidemics Through Nonparametric Estimation of Time-Dependent Transmission Rates Using the SEIR Model,"Smirnova, A.; deCamp, L.; Chowell, G.","Deterministic and stochastic methods relying on early case incidence data for forecasting epidemic outbreaks have received increasing attention during the last few years. In mathematical terms, epidemic forecasting is an ill-posed problem due to instability of parameter identification and limited available data. While previous studies have largely estimated the time-dependent transmission rate by assuming specific functional forms (e.g., exponential decay) that depend on a few parameters, here we introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of nonparametric time-dependent transmission rates by projecting onto a finite subspace spanned by Legendre polynomials. This approach enables us to effectively forecast future incidence cases, the clear advantage over recovering the transmission rate at finitely many grid points within the interval where the data are currently available. In our approach, we compare three regularization algorithms: variational (Tikhonov's) regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), and modified TSVD in order to determine the stabilizing strategy that is most effective in terms of reliability of forecasting from limited data.

Although data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide a solution to this problem, employing a tractable augmented likelihood, such methods typically deteriorate in large populations due to poor mixing and increased computation time. Here, we describe a new approach that seeks to approximate the likelihood by exploiting the underlying structure of the epidemic model.

Fitting stochastic epidemic models to gene genealogies using linear noise approximation,"Tang, M.; Dudas, G.; Bedford, T.; Minin, V. N.","Phylodynamics is a set of population genetics tools that aim at reconstructing demographic history of a population based on molecular sequences of individuals sampled from the population of interest. One important task in phylodynamics is to estimate changes in (effective) population size. When applied to infectious disease sequences such estimation of population size trajectories can provide information about changes in the number of infections. To model changes in the number of infected individuals, current phylodynamic methods use non-parametric approaches (e.g., Bayesian curve-fitting based on change-point models or Gaussian process priors), parametric approaches (e.g., based on differential equations), and stochastic modeling in conjunction with likelihood-free Bayesian methods. The first class of methods yields results that are hard to interpret epidemiologically. The second class of methods provides estimates of important epidemiological parameters, such as infection and removal/recovery rates, but ignores variation in the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The third class of methods is the most advantageous statistically, but relies on computationally intensive particle filtering techniques that limits its applications. We propose a Bayesian model that combines phylodynamic inference and stochastic epidemic models, and achieves computational tractability by using a linear noise approximation (LNA) - a technique that allows us to approximate probability densities of stochastic epidemic model trajectories.

"Assessing reporting delays and the effective reproduction number: The Ebola epidemic in DRC, May 2018-January 2019","Tariq, A.; Roosa, K.; Mizumoto, K.; Chowell, G.","On August 1, 2018, the Democratic Republic of Congo declared its 10th and largest outbreak of Ebola inflicting North Khivu and Ituri provinces. The spread of Ebola to Congolese urban centers along with deliberate attacks on the health care workers has hindered epidemiological surveillance activities, leading to substantial reporting delays. Reporting delays distort the epidemic incidence pattern misrepresenting estimates of epidemic potential and the outbreak trajectory. To assess the impact of reporting delays, we conducted a real-time analysis of the dynamics of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC using epidemiological data retrieved from the World Health Organization Situation Reports and Disease Outbreak News. We analyzed temporal trends in reporting delays, epidemic curves of crude and reporting-delay adjusted incidences and changes in the effective reproduction number, R(t). As of January 15, 2019, 663 Ebola cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The average reporting delay exhibited 81.1% decline from a mean of 17.4 weeks (95% CI 13-24.1) in May, 2018 to 3.3 weeks (95% CI 2.7-4.2) in September, 2018 (F-test statistic = 44.9, p = 0.0067). The Ebola epidemic has shown a two-wave pattern with the first surge in cases occurring between July 30 and August 13, 2018 and the second on September 24, 2018. During the last 4 generation intervals, the trend in the mean R(t) has exhibited a slight decline (rho = -0.37, p < 0.001), fluctuating around 0.9 (range: 0-1.8). Our most recent estimate of R is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.1) during the last generation interval.

Methods for Rapid Mobility Estimation to Support Outbreak Response,"Telionis, P. A.; Corbett, P.; Venkatramanan, S.; Lewis, B.","When pressed for time, outbreak investigators often use homogeneous mixing models to model infectious diseases in data-poor regions. But recent outbreaks such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa have shown the limitations of this approach in an era of increasing urbanization and connectivity. Both outbreak detection and predictive modeling depend on realistic estimates of human and disease mobility, but these data are difficult to acquire in a timely manner. This is especially true when dealing with an emerging outbreak in an under-resourced nation. Weighted travel networks with realistic estimates for population flows are often proprietary, expensive, or nonexistent. Here we propose a method for rapidly generating a mobility model from open-source data. As an example, we use road and river network data, along with population estimates, to construct a realistic model of human movement between health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Using these mobility data, we then fit an epidemic model to real-world surveillance data from the recent Ebola outbreak in the Nord Kivu region of the DRC to illustrate a potential use of the generated mobility estimation. In addition to providing a way for rapid risk estimation, this approach brings together novel techniques to merge diverse GIS datasets that can then be used to address issues that pertain to public health and global health security.",2020,Jan/Feb,Health Secur,18,1,1-15,32078419,10.1089/hs.2019.0101,,#19049,Telionis 2020,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-09 04:11:50)(Select): SEIR model; ,""

A.; Dahlqwist, E.; Li, S.; Miguel, E.; Jombart, T.; Lessler, J.; Cauchemez, S.; Cori, A.","Accurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2).

The rate of semen persistence over time, including the average duration of persistence among Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors, is not well known. This cohort study aimed to analyze population estimates of EBOV RNA persistence rates in semen over time, and associated risk factors in a population of survivors from Sierra Leone. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cohort study from May 2015 to April 2017 in Sierra Leone, recruitment was conducted in 2 phases; the first enrolled 100 male participants from the Western Area District in the capital of Freetown, and the second enrolled 120 men from the Western Area District and from Lungi, Port Loko District. Mean age of participants was 31 years. The men provided semen for testing, analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for the presence of EBOV RNA. Follow-up occurred every 2 weeks until the endpoint, defined as 2 consecutive negative qRT-PCR results of semen specimen testing for EBOV RNA. Participants were matched with the Sierra Leone EVD case database to retrieve cycle threshold (Ct) values from the qRT-PCR analysis done in blood during acute disease. A purposive sampling strategy was used, and the included sample composition was compared to the national EVD survivor database to understand deviations from the general male survivor population. At 180 days (6 months) after Ebola treatment unit (ETU) discharge, the EBOV RNA semen positive rate was 75.4% (95% CI 66.9%-82.0%). The median persistence duration was 204 days, with 50% of men having cleared their semen of EBOV RNA after this time. At 270 days, persistence was 26.8% (95% CI 20.0%-34.2%), and at 360 days, 6.0% (95% CI 3.1%-10.2%). Longer persistence was significantly associated with severe acute disease, with probability of persistence in this population at 1 year at 10.1% (95% CI 4.6%-19.8%) compared to the probability approaching 0% for those with mild acute disease. Age showed a dose-response pattern, where the youngest men (≤25 years) were 3.17 (95% CI 1.60, 6.29) times more likely to be EBOV RNA negative in semen, and men aged 26-35 years were 1.85 (95% CI 1.04, 3.28) times more likely to be negative, than men aged >35 years. Among participants with both severe acute EVD and a higher age (>35 years), persistence remained above 20% (95% CI 6.0%-50.6%) at 1 year. Uptake of safe sex recommendations 3 months after ETU discharge was low among a third of survivors. The sample was largely representative of male survivors in Sierra Leone. A limitation of this study is the lack of knowledge about infectiousness. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we observed that EBOV RNA persistence in semen was a frequent phenomenon, with high population rates over time. This finding will inform forthcoming updated recommendations on risk reduction strategies relating to sexual transmission of EBOV. Our findings support implementation of a semen testing program as part of epidemic preparedness and response.

It is suspected that after violent events occur, EVD transmission will increase; however, empirical studies to understand the impact of violence on transmission are lacking. Here, we use spatial and temporal trends of EVD case counts to compare transmission rates between health zones that have versus have not experienced recent violent events during the outbreak. METHODS: We collected daily EVD case counts from DRC Ministry of Health. A time-varying indicator of recent violence in each health zone was derived from events documented in the WHO situation reports. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate the reproduction number R for each case by day per zone in the 2018-2019 outbreak. We fit an exponentially decaying curve to estimates of R overall and by health zone, for comparison to past outbreaks. RESULTS: As of 16 April 2019, the mean overall R for the entire outbreak was 1.11. We found evidence of an increase in the estimated transmission rates in health zones with recently reported violent events versus those without (p = 0.008). The average R was estimated as between 0.61 and 0.86 in regions not affected by recent violent events, and between 1.01 and 1.07 in zones affected by violent events within the last 21 days, leading to an increase in R between 0.17 and 0.53. Within zones with recent violent events, the mean estimated quenching rate was lower than for all past outbreaks except the 2013-2016 West African outbreak.

D.","BACKGROUND: As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. METHODS: For short- and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short- and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott's rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. RESULTS: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872-1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874-1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876-933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877-983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013-2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.",2019,Aug,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,13,8,e0007512,31381606,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007512,,#19420,Worden 2019,"",""

Using existing data from Liberia, sensitivity analysis of various epidemic scenarios was used to inform the model structure, estimate the basic reproduction number ℜ(0) and investigate how the vaccination could effectively change the course of the epidemic. RESULTS: If a randomized mass vaccination strategy was adopted, vaccines would be administered prophylactically or as early as possible (depending on the availability of vaccines). An effective vaccination rate threshold for Liberia was estimated as 48.74% among susceptible individuals. If a ring vaccination strategy was adopted to control the spread of the Ebola virus, vaccines would be given to reduce the transmission rate improving the tracing rate of the contact persons of an infected individual.

A multi-stage stochastic programming approach to epidemic resource allocation with equity considerations,"Yin, X.; Büyüktahtakın, I.

In this study, we address this core limitation by presenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental model, which integrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control an infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program involves various disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of treatment centers and resources while minimizing the total expected number of new infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics, namely infection and capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment funds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage value of the stochastic solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed stochastic programming model over its deterministic counterpart. We apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and fair resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of infections over all regions, even without including the infection equity or prevalence equity constraints. Model results also show that allocating treatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing such a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of infections and deaths, and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay for the fairness.

Effect of quarantine on transmission dynamics of Ebola virus epidemic: a mathematical analysis,"Ahmad, W.; Abbas, M.","In this paper, a nonlinear model called susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered is developed to study the transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD). In the proposed model, an additional class of quarantined humans is incorporated to investigate the impact of quarantine strategy for exposed population. A comprehensive mathematical analysis of this model is carried out to understand the dynamical behavior of EVD. Equilibrium points F0, F1 and the threshold parameter R0 of the model are evaluated. An analytic stability analysis of equilibrium points with the help of R0 is performed. It is observed that F0 is both locally and globally asymptotically stable when R0 is strictly less than unity which means that there will be no epidemic. Moreover, F0 is not stable and F1 is both locally and globally asymptotically stable when R0 is strictly greater than unity which indicates a uniform spread of disease among individuals. Global stability of both equilibria is established by employing theory of Lyapunov functions. To validate theoretical results thus obtained, the system of ODEs is solved by employing three well-known different numerical methods such as Euler method, Runge-Kutta method of order 4 (RK4), and the nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) method. It is worth mentioning that the Euler and RK4 numerical schemes converge conditionally, whereas the proposed NSFD scheme converges unconditionally and is dynamically consistent with the continuous model. A quantitative analysis of the proposed model at endemic point F1 for different quarantine levels is also presented. We have studied the effect of different quarantine coverage levels on threshold parameter R0 to draw our conclusions. Numerical results drawn using MATLAB validate our claim that EVD could be eradicated faster if quarantine measures with proper awareness at various coverage levels are adopted.

Mathematical analysis to control the spread of Ebola virus epidemic through voluntary vaccination,"Ahmad, W.; Rafiq, M.; Abbas, M.","Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the deadliest viral infections that has caused a serious global health problem in the known human history. It was first transmitted to humans through domestic and wild animals, and then, the spread was through direct and indirect contacts among individuals. To control this spread is one of the most challenging aspects of epidemic studies carried out so far. The aim of this paper is to propose a transmission model called Susceptible-Vaccinated-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SVEIR) by incorporating an additional class of vaccinated individuals. We investigate the rate of spread of EVD in population when the voluntary vaccination is introduced at the level of its susceptibility. Our proposed model helps in better understanding of the dynamical behavior of EVD and explains its stability pattern. We present two main equilibrium points and their stability analysis. It is proven that disease-free equilibrium (DFE) F0 is both locally and globally stable when the value of threshold parameter R0 we obtain through our model is strictly less than one. Moreover, for R0>1, F0 is not stable, and the endemic equilibrium (EE) F1 is locally and globally stable. Hence, EVD spreads uniformly among individuals. We also study the effect of threshold parameter R0 at different vaccination coverage levels to validate our conclusions in this paper. The theory of Lyapunov functions is employed to study global stabilities at both levels. We use Runge-Kutta method of order 4 (RK4) and Non-Standard Finite Difference (NSFD) scheme for the proposed model to confirm our obtained theoretical results through numerical simulations. Furthermore, the discretized SVEIR model obtained by applying NSFD scheme is dynamically consistent with the continuous model for any step size h thus used.

This inclusion has made the model more comprehensive for studying the disease dynamics in the human population. The quantities linked with the model indicate the population sizes which are taken as absolute, therefore, the numerical schemes utilized to solve the underlying Ebola epidemic system should sustain the positivity. The numerical approaches used to solve the underlying epidemic models are explicit nonstandard finite difference operator splitting (ENSFD-OS) and implicit nonstandard finite difference operator splitting (INSFD-OS) techniques. These schemes preserve all the physical features of the state variables, i.e. projected schemes hold the positive solution acquired by the Ebola diffusive epidemic model.

Nonstandard finite difference method revisited and application to the Ebola virus disease transmission dynamics,"Anguelov, R.; Berge, T.; Chapwanya, M.; Djoko, J. K.; Kama, P.; Lubuma, J. M. S.; Terefe, Y.","We provide effective and practical guidelines on the choice of the complex denominator function of the discrete derivative as well as on the choice of the nonlocal approximation of nonlinear terms in the construction of nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes. Firstly, we construct nonstandard one-stage and two-stage theta methods for a general dynamical system defined by a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations. We provide a sharp condition, which captures the dynamics of the continuous model. We discuss at length how this condition is pivotal in the construction of the complex denominator function. We show that the nonstandard theta methods are elementary stable in the sense that they have exactly the same fixed-points as the continuous model and they preserve their stability, irrespective of the value of the step size. For more complex dynamical systems that are dissipative, we identify a class of nonstandard theta methods that replicate this property. We apply the first part by considering a dynamical system that models the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The formulation of the model involves both the fast/direct and slow/indirect transmission routes. Using the specific structure of the EVD model, we show that, apart from the guidelines in the first part, the nonlocal approximation of nonlinear terms is guided by the productive-destructive structure of the model, whereas the choice of the denominator function is based on the conservation laws and the sub-equations that are associated with the model. We construct a NSFD scheme that is dynamically consistent with respect to the properties of the continuous model such as: positivity and boundedness of solutions; local and/or global asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points; dependence of the severity of the infection on self-protection measures.

"Nonlinear equations with global differential and integral operators: Existence, uniqueness with application to epidemiology","Atangana, A.; Araz, S. I.","Very recently, the concept of instantaneous change was extended with the aim to accommodate prediction of more complex real world problems that could not be predicted or depicted by the existing rate of change. The extension gave birth to a more general differential operator that to be a derivative associate to the well-known Riemann-Stieltjes integral. In addition to this, using specific functions, one is able to recover all existing local differential operators defined as rate of change. This extended concept is still at its genesis and more works need to be done to establish a Riemann-Stieltjes calculus. In this paper, we aim to present a detailed analysis of an important class of differential equations called stochastic equations with the new classes of differential operators with the global derivative with integer and non-integer orders. We considered many classes as nonlinear Cauchy problems, then we presented existence and the uniqueness of their solutions using the linear growth and the Lipchitz conditions. We derived numerical solutions for each class and presented the error analysis. To show the applicability of these operators, we considered three epidemiological problems, including the zombie virus spread model, the zika virus spread model and Ebola model.

Such an epidemic model incorporates asymptomatic and dead-infectious subpopulations to those of the typical SEIR models and, in parallel, three types of controls including feedback information and impulsive actions. In particular, the model incorporates feedback vaccination controls on the susceptible subpopulation and antiviral treatment controls on the symptomatic infectious subpopulations as well as infectious corpses removal. Those controls may incorporate constant, linear and impulsive terms and an additional quadratic feedback term in the treatment control law. The infectious corpses removal control is impulsive by nature. The practical implementation of that control consists in organization or brigades for lying bodies removal being active along short and intermittent periods of time. The positivity and the existence/non-existence of the endemic equilibrium point are investigated as well as the local stability properties around the equilibrium points and periodic steady-state solutions. The global stability is investigated via a Lyapunov function for the incremental systems about the equilibrium solution which is supported by an ""ad hoc"" designed time-varying Lyapunov equation.

Long-Term Bifurcation and Stochastic Optimal Control of a Triple-Delayed Ebola Virus Model with Vaccination and Quarantine Strategies,"Din, A.; Khan, A.; Sabbar, Y.","Despite its high mortality rate of approximately 90%, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) has not received enough attention in terms of in-depth research.

The least residual squares sum is used as fitness function to measure the performance of GA in parameter estimation. Moreover, we used a dynamical model and the real data of Ebola in Sierra Leone to verify the validity of GA.

Dynamical analysis and control strategies in modelling Ebola virus disease,"Mhlanga, A.","Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe infection with an extremely high fatality rate spread through direct and indirect contacts. Recently, an outbreak of EVD in West Africa brought public attention to this deadly disease. We study the spread of EVD through a two-patch model. We determine the basic reproduction number, the disease-free equilibrium, two boundary equilibria and the endemic equilibrium when the disease persists in the two sub-populations for specific conditions. Further, we introduce time-dependent controls into our proposed model. We analyse the optimal control problem where the control system is a mathematical model for EVD that incorporates educational campaigns. The control functions represent educational campaigns in their respective patches, with one patch having more effective controls than the other.

A novel design of evolutionally computing to study the quarantine effects on transmission model of Ebola virus disease,"Nisar, K. S.; Shoaib, M.; Raja, M. A.

A genetic algorithm can combine multiple approaches within its framework to create a hybrid that benefits the most from the combination. In this article, a new methodology of hybrid genetic algorithm using sequential quadratic programming (HGASQP) is presented to optimize the transmission dynamics of the Ebola virus disease model (EVDM) by implementing the intelligent paradigm of feed-forward neural networks. The Ebola virus, also known as Ebola haemorrhagic, is a transmitter virus that was initially transferred to humans by wild and domestic animals, and then it spread from human to human.

MethodsIn this paper, we formulate a model of Ebola virus disease that considers two patches with different economic statuses represented by the respective gross-national incomes of the two patches. First, we consider a one-directional movement from a poorer patch to a rich patch. Second, we consider a two-way migration model where people move between patches. ResultsThe steady states of the model are determined and analyzed. The analysis shows also that the disease free and the endemic equilibrium points are locally stable. The analysis also shows that a unique endemic equilibrium point exists in the poor patch when the reproduction number in this patch is greater than one and multiple endemic equilibria exist in the rich patch when the reproduction number in the poor patch is less than one. The model dynamics of the rich patch present a backward bifurcation which does not facilitate easy Ebola virus disease control. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the most sensitive parameters that must be carefully estimated for the successful control of the Ebola virus disease. DiscussionNumerical simulations indicate a decrease in the number of infected individuals in the rich patch when movements of populations are limited through the improvement of the economy in the poor patch.

Ebola virus transmits to people through domestic and wild animals, called transmitting agents, and then spreads into the human population through close and direct contact among individuals. To study the dynamics and to illustrate the stability pattern of Ebola virus in human population, we have developed an SEIR type model consisting of coupled nonlinear differential equations. These equations provide a good tool to discuss the mode of impact of Ebola virus on the human population through domestic and wild animals. We first formulate the proposed model and obtain the value of threshold parameter R0 for the model. We then determine both the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE) and discuss the stability of the model. We show that both the equilibrium states are locally asymptotically stable. Employing Lyapunov functions theory, global stabilities at both the levels are carried out.

Stochastic dynamics of the fractal-fractional Ebola epidemic model combining a fear and environmental spreading mechanism,"Rashid, S.; Jarad, F.","Recent Ebola virus disease infections have been limited to human-to-human contact as well as the intricate linkages between the habitat, people and socioeconomic variables. The mechanisms of infection propagation can also occur as a consequence of variations in individual actions brought on by dread. This work studies the evolution of the Ebola virus disease by combining fear and environmental spread using a compartmental framework considering stochastic manipulation and a newly defined non-local fractal-fractional (F-F) derivative depending on the generalized Mittag-Leffler kernel. To determine the incidence of infection and person-to-person dissemination, we developed a fear-dependent interaction rate function.

Moreover, we examine the existence-uniqueness of non-negative solutions for the given randomized process. The ergodicity and stationary distribution of the infection are then demonstrated, along with the basic criteria for its eradication.

Mathematical modelling and nonstandard finite scheme analysis for an Ebola model transmission with information and voluntary isolation,"Tadmon, C.; Kengne, J.

On August 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak public health emergency of international concern. In this work, we propose an epidemic model to study the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with high- and low-risk susceptible populations. Our aim is to analyse and assess the impacts of positive and negative information conveyed on the field about EVD spreading. The model considers two different groups of susceptible individuals depending on the level of information about the disease spreading. We provide a theoretical study of the model, compute the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and derive the basic reproduction number R-0 that determines the extinction and the persistence of the disease. Also, we compute equilibria and study their stability. More precisely, we show that the DFE is globally asymptotically stable whenever R-0 <= 1. Conversely, when R-0 is greater than one, the DFE becomes unstable and a unique endemic equilibrium arises which is locally asymptotically stable. These results are obtained through the construction of suitable Lyapunov functions combined with Lyapunov-LaSalle techniques and the search for the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, respectively. We design a nonstandard finite difference scheme, which preserves the essential properties of the continuous system.

Mathematical analysis of a model of Ebola disease with control measures,"Tadmon, C.; Kengne, J. N.","The re-emergence of the Ebola virus disease has pushed researchers to investigate more on this highly deadly disease in order to better understand and control the outbreak and recurrence of epidemics. It is in this perspective that we formulate a realistic mathematical model for the dynamic transmission of Ebola virus disease, incorporating relevant control measures and factors such as ban on eating bush-meat, social distancing, observance of hygiene rules and containment, waning of the vaccine-induced, imperfect contact tracing and vaccine efficacy, quarantine, hospitalization and screening to fight against the spread of the disease. First, by considering the constant control parameters case, we thoroughly compute the control reproduction number R-0(c) from which the dynamics of the model is analyzed. The existence and stability of steady states are established under appropriate assumptions on R-0(c). Also, the effect of all the control measures is investigated and the global sensitivity analysis of the control reproduction number is performed in order to determine the impact of parameters and their relative importance to disease transmission and prevalence. Second, in the time-dependent control parameters case, an optimal control problem is formulated to design optimal control strategies for eradicating the disease transmission. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we derive necessary conditions for optimal control of the disease. The cost-effectiveness analysis of all combinations of the control measures is made by calculating the infection averted ratio and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. This reveals that combining the four restrictive measures conveyed through educational campaigns, screening, safe burial and the care of patients in health centers for better isolation is the most cost-effective among the strategies considered.

Modeling and stability analysis of epidemic expansion disease Ebola virus with implications prevention in population,"Tahir, M.; Anwar, N.; Shah, S. I. A.; Khan, T.","In this subsection, we presented a mathematical model of Ebola virus (EBOV) proposed by susceptible exposed infected recovered (SEIR) model. In our model, the population is affected by animals. EBOV is an infectious agent causing haemorraghic fever, a severe infectious disease characterised by high fever and bleeding, in humans and some monkeys. Here, we assessed the transmissibility associated with the infection stages of EBOV that generated an epidemic model. In order to do this, in the first step, we formulate the model, and the basic properties of the proposed model are presented. The basic reproductive number is obtained by using the next generation matrix approach. Then, all the endemic equilibrium points related to the disease are derived. We also find the conditions to investigate all possible equilibria of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number (local and global stability). In last, numerical simulation is presented with and without vaccination or control for the proposed model.",2019,Jun,Cogent Biology,5,1,,WOS:000472497900001,10.1080/23312025.2019.1619219,,#23674,Tahir 2019,"",""
EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE DYNAMICS WITH SOME PREVENTIVE MEASURES: A CASE STUDY OF THE 2018-2020 KIVU OUTBREAK,"Tasse, A. J. O.; Tsanou, B.; Lubuma, J.; Woukeng, J. L.; Signing, F.","To fight against Ebola virus disease, several measures have been adopted. Among them, isolation, safe burial and vaccination occupy a prominent place. In this paper, we present a model which takes into account these three control strategies as well as the indirect transmission through a polluted environment. The asymptotic behavior of our model is achieved. Namely, we determine a threshold value R-c(c), of the control reproduction number R-c, below which the disease is eliminated in the long run. Whenever the value of R-c, ranges from R-c(c) and 1, we prove the existence of a backward bifurcation phenomenon, which corresponds to the case, where a locally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium co-exists with the disease-free equilibrium, which is also locally asymptotically stable. The existence of this bifurcation complicates the control of Ebola, since the requirement of R-c below one, although necessary, is no longer sufficient for the elimination of Ebola, more efforts nerd to be deployed. When the value of R-c is greater than one, we prove the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium, locally asymptotically stable. That is the disease may persist and become endemic. Numerically, we fit our model to the reported data for the 2018-2020 Kivu Ebola outbreak which occurred in Democratic Republic of Congo. Through the sensitivity analysis of the control reproduction number, we prove that the transmission rates of infected alive who are outside hospital are the most influential parameters. Numerically, we explore the usefulness of isolation, safe burial combined with vaccination and investigate the importance to combine the latter control strategies to the educational campaigns or/and case finding.",2022,Mar,Journal of Biological Systems,30,01,113-148,WOS:000780103300005,10.1142/s0218339022500048,,#23719,Tasse 2022,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-15 17:57:34)(Select): Please don't exclude yet - waiting on library; ,""
An open-access database of infectious disease transmission trees to explore superspreader epidemiology,"Taube, J. C.; Miller, P. B.; Drake, J. M.","Historically, emerging an reemerging infectious diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive multinational outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals and branches representing transmission from person to person. We compiled a database, called OutbreakTrees, of 382 published, standardized transmission trees consisting of 16 directly transmitted diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree and disease, we calculated several key statistics, such as tree size, average number of secondary infections, the dispersion parameter, and the proportion of cases considered superspreaders, and examined how these statistics varied over the course of each outbreak and under different assumptions about the completeness of outbreak investigations. We demonstrated the potential utility of the database through 2 short analyses addressing questions about superspreader epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). First, we found that our transmission trees were consistent with theory predicting that intermediate dispersion parameters give rise to the highest proportion of cases causing superspreading events. Additionally, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders are infected. Across trees with more than 1 superspreader, we found preliminary support for the theory that superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In sum, our findings put the role of superspreading in COVID-19 transmission in perspective with that of other diseases and suggest an approach to further research regarding the generation of superspreaders. These data have been made openly available to encourage reuse and further scientific inquiry.",2022,Jun,Plos Biology,20,6,,WOS:000926446800005,10.1371/journal.pbio.3001685,,#23720,Taube 2022,Juliette Unwin (2023-08-15 00:14:42)(Select): over dispersion in figure but numbers are given so included; ,""
Transmission dynamics of epidemic spread and outbreak of Ebola in West Africa: fuzzy modeling and simulation,"Verma, R.; Tiwari, S. P.; Upadhyay, R. K.","In this paper, an attempt is made to understand the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease (EVD) incorporating fuzziness in all biological parameters due to its natural variability. To characterize the transmission trajectories of Ebola outbreak, we propose and analyze two SEIR and SEIRHD type transmission models. Using triangular fuzzy numbers for the imprecise parameters, we first study the existence of the equilibria and their stability. Both of the model have two equilibria, namely the disease-free and endemic. Stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria is related with basic reproduction number that has been calculated from next generation matrix. Stability analysis of the system shows that the disease free equilibrium is locally as well as globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Under some additional conditions, the model system becomes locally asymptotically stable at unique endemic equilibrium when basic reproduction number is greater than unity. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments to justify the theoretical estimate.",2019,Jun,Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing,60,1-2,637-671,WOS:000468534700031,10.1007/s12190-018-01231-0,,#23896,Verma 2019,"",""
Stationary distribution of a stochastic SIRD epidemic model of Ebola with double saturated incidence rates and vaccination,"Wang, P. P.; Jia, J.

Incorporating infectious duration-dependent transmission into Bayesian epidemic models,"Ward, C.; Brown, G. D.; Oleson, J. J.","Compartmental models are commonly used to describe the spread of infectious diseases by estimating the probabilities of transitions between important disease states. A significant challenge in fitting Bayesian compartmental models lies in the need to estimate the duration of the infectious period, based on limited data providing only symptom onset date or another proxy for the start of infectiousness. Commonly, the exponential distribution is used to describe the infectious duration, an overly simplistic approach, which is not biologically plausible. More flexible distributions can be used, but parameter identifiability and computational cost can worsen for moderately sized or large epidemics. In this article, we present a novel approach, which considers a curve of transmissibility over a fixed infectious duration. The incorporation of infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmissibility, which decays to zero during the infectious period, is biologically reasonable for many viral infections and fixing the length of the infectious period eases computational complexity in model fitting. Through simulation, we evaluate different functional forms of IDD transmissibility curves and show that the proposed approach offers improved estimation of the time-varying reproductive number. We illustrate the benefit of our approach through a new analysis of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",2022,2022 Oct,Biometrical Journal,,,,WOS:000871904300001,10.1002/bimj.202100401,,#23986,Ward 2022,"",""
Monitoring real-time transmission heterogeneity from incidence data,"Zhang, Y. J.; Britton, T.; Zhou, X. H.","The transmission heterogeneity of an epidemic is associated with a complex mixture of host, pathogen and environmental factors. And it may indicate superspreading events to reduce the efficiency of population-level control measures and to sustain the epidemic over a larger scale and a longer duration. Methods have been proposed to identify significant transmission heterogeneity in historic epidemics based on several data sources, such as contact history, viral genomes and spatial information, which may not be available, and more importantly ignore the temporal trend of transmission heterogeneity. Here we attempted to establish a convenient method to estimate real-time heterogeneity over an epidemic. Within the branching process framework, we introduced an instant-individualheterogenous infectiousness model to jointly characterize the variation in infectiousness both between individuals and among different times. With this model, we could simultaneously estimate the transmission heterogeneity and the reproduction number from incidence time series. We validated the model with data of both simulated and real outbreaks. Our estimates of the overall and real-time heterogeneities of the six epidemics were consistent with those presented in the literature. Additionally, our model is robust to the ubiquitous bias of under-reporting and misspecification of serial interval. By analyzing recent data from South Africa, we found evidence that the Omicron might be of more significant transmission heterogeneity than Delta. Our model based on incidence data was proved to be reliable in estimating the real-time transmission heterogeneity. Author Summary The transmission of many infectious diseases is usually heterogeneous in time and space. Such transmission heterogeneity may indicate superspreading events (where some infected individuals transmit to disproportionately more susceptibles than others), reduce the efficiency of the population-level control measures, and sustain the epidemic over a larger scale and a longer duration. Classical methods of monitoring epidemic spread centered on the reproduction number which represent the average transmission potential of the epidemic at the population level, but failed to reflect the systematic variation in transmission. Several recent methods have been proposed to identify significant transmission heterogeneity in the epidemics such as Ebola, MERS, COVID-19. However, these methods are developed based on some sophisticated information such as contact history, viral genome and spatial information, of the confirmed cases, which are typically field-specific and not easy to generalize. In this study, we proposed a simple and generic method of estimating transmission heterogeneity from incidence time series, which provided consistent estimation of heterogeneity with those records with detailed data. It also helps in exploring the transmission heterogeneity of the newly emerging variant of Omicron. Our model enhances current understanding of epidemic dynamics, and highlight the potential importance of targeted control measures.",2022,Dec,Plos Computational Biology,18,12,,WOS:000925744100001,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010078,,#24286,Zhang 2022,"Tristan Naidoo (2023-08-10 05:00:30)(Select): Rt in a figure and estimate of dispersion param.

A likelihood‐based method for real‐time estimation of the serial interval and reproductive number of an epidemic,"Forsberg White, L.; Pagano, M.","<p> We present a method for the simultaneous estimation of the basic reproductive number, <italic>R</italic> <sub>0</sub> , and the serial interval for infectious disease epidemics, using readily available surveillance data. These estimates can be obtained in real time to inform an appropriate public health response to the outbreak. We show how this methodology, in its most simple case, is related to a branching process and describe similarities between the two that allow us to draw parallels which enable us to understand some of the theoretical properties of our estimators. We provide simulation results that illustrate the efficacy of the method for estimating <italic>R</italic> <sub>0</sub> and the serial interval in real time. Finally, we implement our proposed method with data from three infectious disease outbreaks.
